 without the Force or a Lightsaber, Isley is a deadly opponent. Since 
shortly after his infancy, he has been raised in the traditional manner 
of a Mandalorian. Being that he was, quite literally, bred to be a 
warrior, Isley is excessively resourceful and knows his way around a 
variety of weapons and vehicles.<br>

 from the "basics", Isley's abilities are an intersection of Personal Combat 
Augmentation and Alteration. Having spent the majority of his lifetime steeped within 
the study and usage of these branches of the Force, Isley is currently a
 master of both of these disciplines.<br>

constant training in the blade. His Mandalorian upbringing allowed him 
to become an excellent shot and well-versed with a variety of weapons

<li><span style="color:#ff0000">-</span>&nbsp;<strong><span style="color:#daa520">Force Hypersensitivity:</span></strong>&nbsp;Due
 to his Sunrider heritage, compliments of Gregor, Isley has a rather high 
sensitivity when faced with sudden, and immense changes in the Force; such as 
the annihlation of an entire planet. Though the response is not as violent as 
what is typically experienced by full sensors, Isley can enter 
an episode just shy of a full seizure if exposed to the aforementioned, sudden 
changes in the Force while focusing on it. It is for this reason that 
Isley rarely opens himself up to the full sensory abilities of the Force to a 
Galactic Scale.</li>

&nbsp;<p></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family:georgia, serif"><span style="color:#daa520"><strong>Origins: Clan Verd and the Gulag Plague</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Centuries ago, long before the Gulag Plague was even a memory, a 
conflict erupted within the Mandalorian people. On one side was the 
Death Watch: a radical, militant cell formed by Clan Viszla. On the 
other were the True Mandalorians, led by the valiant Mand'alor: Jaster 
Mereel. The conflict revolved around the culture of the Mandalorian 
people as a whole; yet just as the fighting exploded into an all-out 
war, there was a surprising defection on the side of the Death Watch. A 
handful of Clan Vizsla's own banded together in defiance of the Death 
Watch and took up the cause of the True Mandalorians, seeing the truth 
in their way of life. What's more, out of shame due to their former 
affiliation with Clan Vizsla, the defectors united under a single name: 
the Mand'oa word for "warrior". Thus, Clan Verd was born. From 
thenceforth, they diligently served whomever held the title of Mand'alor
 and fiercely adhered to the tenets that dictated the Mandalorian 
lifestyle. From the clash of the clans, to the Clone Wars, to the Fall 
of the Empire, to the Vong War, and beyond, Clan Verd distinguished 
themselves due to their loyalty to the Mand'alor, and by extension the 
Mandalorian people as a whole.<br><br>
Then came the Gulag Plague...<br><br>
During the outbreak of the Gulag Plague, widespread panic gripped the 
known Galaxy. All throughout the stars, worlds were collapsing and 
millions upon millions of lives were lost with each and every day. Some 
stayed within the hell that had once been known as their homeworlds, 
desperately fighting against the disease which mercilessly ravaged the 
planets...and others fled. Countless vessels, of all shapes and sizes, 
flooded the Hyperlanes shortly after the Plague reached its apex; and 
amongst this literal stampede of refugees was a small, humble freighter 
which had escaped the world of Kiffex. Within this vessel were huddled 
together the remains of a merchant family: a brother and sister pair who
 had abandoned their crumbling world in order to chase a rumor of 
sanctuary.<br><br>
And that rumor centered around the distant, Outer Rim world of Mandalore.<br><br>
According to the transmission which had trickled its way across the 
known Galaxy, the world owned by the warrior culture was opening its 
doors to those affected by the Plague. Of course, they would need to 
spend a period of six months in quarantine within the system, so that 
those possibly infected would die off and leave the denizens of 
Mandalore unaffected. Being that the siblings were untouched by the 
sickness, they eagerly made the voyage to Mandalore, and following their
 period of isolation, were accepted with open arms into the foreign 
society. Of course, in order to stay, they would have to work. The 
brother, elder of the pair, resumed his role as a merchant and began to 
organize daring missions to brave the worlds ravaged by the Gulag 
Plague. Their directive was to salvage anything that could be of use.<br><br>
The sister assisted in this quest as well, but ultimately settled into 
the role of Mandalorian wife after falling in love with a member of Clan
 Verd. This family was, during that span of time, one of the minor clans
 of Mandalorian society. However, through the assistance of the 
siblings, they rose to prominance over the course of the centuries 
following the outbreak of the Gulag Plague. It was their unparalleled 
boldness and willingness to dive where no sane man would dare that 
secured them their fame and position within the Mandalorian society of 
the present. Whenever a task which was labelled suicidal or impossible 
arose, it was a Verd who would willingly answer the call for the Glory 
of Mandalore.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family:georgia, serif"><span style="color:#daa520"><strong>Early Life</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
It had taken several centuries for the Galaxy to recover from the Gulag 
Plague and in year 819 ABY, the borders of Mandalore began to reopen in 
earnest. This was not the only change which had graced the warrior 
planet, for a son was born into the now-prominent Clan Verd. By the 
reigning Patriarch of the family, the newborn was given the name Isley; 
the name of the elder sibling who had helped catapult the Clan into 
greatness centuries prior. The tale of Isley's birth was one written in 
heartache, for a young Umbaran by the name Demia once loved the 
Patriarch of Clan Verd. Isley's sire was a great man in many respects, 
however, he had a weakness for the majesty that is women. Though loving 
and affectionate towards the beginning of his relationships, he quickly 
turned into a boiling mass of anger and verbal abuse that saw the loss 
of his first wife: the mother of Rigard. Demia, foreign to the world 
Mandalore and her lover's tendencies, fell deeply in love with the man, 
and through this union was born Isley. However, shortly thereafter, 
history repeated itself and Demia tearfully put an end to their 
marriage. She attempted to take Isley with her back home to Umbara, but 
due to the Patriarch's stern stance that his son be raised Mandalorian, 
she too bid him a sad farewell. Shortly thereafter, the Patriarch found a
 new wife once more, with whom were conceived Isley's younger siblings, 
namely Ginnie Ordo and Oron Verd.<br><br>
It was almost ironic that Isley had been given such a strong, ancestral 
name, for his body was sickly and frail in comparison to the tale of his
 ancestor. What's more, for the entirety of his infancy, his father 
looked upon him with utter disgust and contempt; born out of frustration
 towards Demia and disappointment in his son's weakness. As opposed to 
showing him kindness and care, he focused entirely on grooming Rigard 
for the mantle of Patriarch during the whole of Isley's infancy.<br><br>
Though Rigard, Isley's elder brother, held no ill will for his younger 
sibling, the seeds of jealousy and hatred were sown in the youngling's 
heart. As such, once his body was free of the sicknesses which had 
characterized his initial years, Isley focused himself entirely upon 
being the absolute greatest warrior he could be. He studied at the feet 
of several warriors of many clans, hoping that their teachings in the 
Mandalorian ways could help him live up to his birthright; and in time, 
the child grew old and strong enough for an opportunity to prove himself
 worthy of the title Initiate. In order to pass this trial, he had to 
complete a task of immense valor; one that took all that he had learned 
over the years and applied them...while pushing him to the absolute 
limit.<br><br>
The opportunity to do so came when disaster struck the very heart of Clan Verd.<br><br>
Whilst living up to the reputation that had come to characterize Clan 
Verd, Rigard had found himself ambushed in the midst of Hutt Space. His 
purpose for being so far away from home was simple: in his freetime, he 
worked as a freelancer and even took the occasional bounty. It was on 
one of these downtime ventures that he lost his life, attempting to 
collect on the head of a Hutt...who turned out to be a rather powerful 
criminal boss in his chosen sector. When word reached Mandalore of this 
passing, Isley took his brother's armor for his own and vowed to avenge 
his death. Under the cover of darkness, the hopeful Initiate infiltrated
 the residence of the Hutt and put an end to his miserable life; then 
triumphantly returned home bearing the head of the mongrel to his Clan.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#daa520"><span style="font-family:georgia, serif"><strong>Captivity &amp; A Life Debt</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
In the eyes of his people, he had done well and had brought much glory 
to the people of Mandalore; but his father, blinded by his grief, did 
not so much as pat the youth on his back. Perhaps it was due to his 
young age, being only sixteen at the time, but Isley took this blatant 
neglect straight to the soul. As far as he was concerned, his sire did 
not treat him like a son...so why should he look to him as a father? 
This passionate, yet rebellious, line of thinking led him to identify 
another as a "father figure": the leader of their people himself. While 
Isley had very little personal interactions with Mandalore the 
Rebuilder, he soon came to idolize the very ground that the man tread 
upon. He came to aspire to, someday, ascend to the mantle of Mandalore; 
and to do all in his power to assist the "father of his people" in 
bringing glory to Mandalore.<br><br>
To this end, Isley was placed under the supervision of Halik Falkosi and
 had the honor of working alongside a brave number of warriors. 
Together, they conquered in the name of Mandalore, fought against the 
one who would become Sith Emperor, and truly embodied all that it meant 
to be a son of Manda'yaim. However, the young Initiate would find his 
own tragedy in the form of lowered guard. He thought that he had made a 
friend in a Sith Apprentice...yet that same Apprentice would prove to be
 his downfall, for she turned on him when the opportunity presented 
itself. He was beaten, broken, stripped of his armor, and detained in a 
Force-forsaken prison on Tatooine for a period of three years. Over the 
course of that time, each day was filled to the brim with torture; for 
the Empire was eyeing the Mandalorian space for any hint of weakness.<br><br>
Yet, Isley did not give them a shred of information, and following the 
Confederacy of Independent Systems' occupation of the world in question,
 he managed to escape the clutches of the Apprentice and into the 
custody of the new nation. He found medical treatment and good treatment
 in the new congregation of worlds, and shortly thereafter made a brief 
return to Mandalore. He fully expected to find that Mandalore the 
Rebuilder had led their people into a glorious war against the 
Empire...only to find that the man he looked to as a father had been 
slain and that the title of Mandalore had changed hands several times in
 his absence. The young warrior was crushed to learn this fact, and was 
utterly disgusted with the sordid state of his people. Instead of taking
 the fight to the enemy, they relied upon the Galactic Republic and 
Omega Pyre for assistance in their "plight".<br><br>
To say the least, his people were a shadow of their former selves, so 
Isley decided to spend his first years of freedom paying the debt to 
those who had liberated him from the doors of death. The Confederacy of 
Independent Systems treated him quite well, and it was through them that
 he received his initial training in the Force after the discovery of 
his sensitivity on Wayland. However, before this span of time began, 
Isley took it upon himself to have the armor that once belonged to his 
elder brother reforged. This was, quite literally, the last contact he 
had with his people...and the last time he lived a day without 
depression in his heart. This sordid state of mind ate at him throughout
 his operations in service to the CIS, even whilst doing good beside his
 newfound friends Feena Mason and Praxis.<br><br>
And ultimately...it lead to a terrible decision.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family:georgia, serif"><span style="color:#daa520"><strong>The Wayward Son of Mandalore</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
In a fit of anger and indecision, Isley decided to do something quite 
rash. He took his starfighter and flew into the border of Sith Space, 
hellbent on ending his life...along with as many Imperials as he could 
get his hands on. Of course, his heading was immediately intercepted by 
an Imperial patrol and he was dragged aboard by the lead vessel's 
tractor beams. Surrounded on all sides by Stormtroopers, Isley did that 
which he had set his mind on doing; and began to fight. Though obviously
 outgunned and outnumbered, he claimed a solid number of kills before 
the acting Sith aboard graced the hanger with his presence. There, 
Gregor and Isley interacted for the first time; and it was through this 
interaction that Isley earned the right to boast.<br><br>
For he, at the doors of death, uppercut a Sith Knight square in the jaw.<br><br>
However, Gregor saw the potential in a force-trained Mandalorian and 
made Isley an offer he could not refuse. Serve him as an apprentice, 
learn his ways, and aide in the toppling of Darth Voracitos from his 
throne. What Mandalorian would pass up the opportunity to assist in 
killing an Emperor? As such, with the succumbing to the temptation of 
the enemy of his people, Isley felt that he no longer deserved to carry 
the name given to him. As such, he adopted the Mando'ad word for Sith, 
Dar'jetii, as his name from thenceforth. Following his assistance in the
 coup, in which that which was promised to him came to fruition, 
Dar'jetii served as an enforcer to the Empire. Yet this was short-lived,
 for the Mandalorian's ties to the Empire relied upon Gregor and his 
suprior Tyrin Ardik.<br><br>
And with his coup, Dar'jetii felt no need to tarry within the Empire any longer.<br><br>
For quite some time, the Mandalorian wandered the stars, taking bounties
 and other jobs as they came his way. Every so often, he would venture 
South and participate in a mission of Confederate origin, alongside his 
old friends Feena and Praxis. Yet, for months upon months, his future 
remained unclear. To say that Isley was lost during that span of time 
was an understatement, yet change and stability soon manifested itself 
in the form of yet another, seemingly random mission. Having received 
the information from the Confederacy's intelligence division, he 
ventured to the world of Adarlon in order to investigate disappearances 
which were occurring within the local population. What he found was 
quite...disturbing...'twas a cult worshipping a statue of gray stone. 
They sacrificed innocent people before this so-called "Gray Goddess", 
and Isley promptly exacted justice by wiping them off of the face of the
 planet. Then, as if reacting to the sudden presence of a wielder of 
Darkness, cracks began to form on the goddess' surface.<br><br>
When the pieces all fell away, there stood the actual "deity": Phoebe 
Verd. She was a woman of astounding beauty who had somehow become prey 
to extended carbonite imprisonment, only to break free in response to 
Isley's presence. He, captivated, could not help but feel some sort of 
responsibility for the woman and personally saw to her rehabilitation; 
bringing her to the Sanctuary on Adarlon for prompt care. From thence, 
he utilized the mountain of credits he had been amassing in order to 
construct a rather sizable estate; dubbing it Castle Ne'tra. Upon its 
completion, he opened the doors to his home to the "Gray Goddess" and 
continued to look after her. She, in turn, joined the Templar Order and 
stood by his side on a wide variety of matters and missions. Time would 
see the development of feelings between the two that ultimately 
culminated with Phoebe's confronting him about their "relationship" one 
day. When they finally admitted to one another that they had developed 
rather strong feelings for one another, they decided to give a literal 
relationship a try.<br><br>
Being that it was Isley's first romantic involvement, he found himself 
fumbling about on a variety of issues; such as dates and displays of 
affection. Yet as time wore on, their relationship truly took off. 
Although their time together could be numbered in months, they decided 
to acknowledge just how short life was in the Galaxy these days. At an 
instant, a mission gone wrong could tear their happiness apart...so they
 woke Isley's old friend, Feena, up late in the evening with a heartfelt
 request: to marry them on the spot. Although the Archon was the 
definition of skeptical at this request, as she was well within her 
rights to be, she relented and allowed her friend to have his shred of 
happiness. From thence, the newlyweds set about starting their new life 
together and attempted to bring a bundle of joy into the world. Yet, 
their efforts were all but fruitless. When Isley looked into the 
difficulties, he came to discover that the torments he had undergone 
during his imprisonment had resulted in his inability to sire a child. 
He was crushed to the very core...and slowly began to obsess over 
somehow, someway, circumventing this plight.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-family:georgia, serif"><span style="color:#daa520"><strong>Enter the Dread Guard</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
For weeks on end, Isley began to research potential avenues to overcome 
his grievous shortcoming...and he ultimately came upon the realization 
that cloning was a viable option. As such, he ventured to the storming 
world of Kamino and commissioned the cloning specialists there to 
utilize his and Phoebe's DNA to create children. However, what he did 
not anticipate was the difficulties of creating Force Sensitive clones; a
 problem that manifested due to the strong Force presence of Isley and 
his wife. Regardless of this challenge, he urged the Kaminoans to 
proceed and was ultimately blessed with two children...after several 
failed attempts. Their names came to be Anastasia Verd and Adela Verd; 
and both were the pride and joy of Isley and Phoebe's lives. 
However...as much as Isley would have liked to devote the totality of 
his time to his newly-formed family, there were newfound 
responsibilities that called for his attention. In the time it took for 
his children to be "born", he had begun to take an active role within 
the Confederacy. His rank was equivalent to that of a Colonel and he 
came to be the Marshal of the Templar Order; second only to his dear 
friend Feena.<br><br>
As such, there were concerns that called for his attention...military 
concerns. The borders of the Galactic community were rapidly expanding 
with each day it seemed; and soon war would come upon the 
Confederacy...of this, Isley was certain. He then claimed that, in order
 to make certain that his wife and beloved children were safe from the 
fires of war, he would dedicate himself to the task of formulating a way
 to defend the nation. However, the true motivations of this ambitious 
undertaking are known only to the Mandalorian himself. What he, a 
Kaminoan, and a Rodian Yuuzhan Vong came up with was a rather novel 
idea...a legion of clone troopers that were dead to the Force; almost as
 if they were Yuuzhan Vong themselves. Ten thousand of these warriors 
were commissioned and were born under a single name: The Dread Guard. 
Under the leadership of a duo of clones whom Isley would consider closer
 than brothers, Calico Tal'verda and Galaar Tal'Verda, the clone legion 
entered into active duty immediately after the fall of the Sith Empire. A
 series of daring operations, known as the Eastern Campaign, were 
launched by the collaborative efforts of the Dread Guard and Isley; 
resulting in an impressive sum of worlds entering the Confederacy's 
fold. While the battles were hard and kept Isley away from his family, 
they were well worth the effort...for each offensive cut down remnants 
of the Sith Empire that would pose a threat to the Confederacy as a 
whole.<br><br>
At the conclusion of the campaign, Isley finally knew rest and reunited 
with his beloved family. He was confident that, with the Dread Guard 
behind him, no threat could dare knock upon the doors of the nation and 
threaten that which he cherished...but that proved to be little more 
than a delusion. After Calico's ascension to the mantle of Grand 
Marshal, an exodus was prompted...practically overnight. A solid chunk 
of the Dread Guard defected into an organization known as Liberty 
Concord, which swiftly dove under the skirt of the Confederacy's 
neighbor: the Omega Protectorate. Isley could not believe that people he
 fought and bled alongside would up and betray their home like that; a 
fact that send the Mandalorian's mind reeling. However, he had to keep 
up the good fight, lest the Confederacy (and by extension his wife and 
children) suffer as a result. To this end, he briefly stepped away from 
the military lifestyle in exchange for a more diplomatic role; through 
which he returned home to Mandalore for the first time in quite some 
time. There, he met with the reigning Mand'alor, Gilamar Skirata, and 
was given an opportunity to absolve the Dar'manda status that he had 
been labeled with.<br><br>
Rising to the occasion, Isley swiftly and eagerly completed the trial 
laid out before him and was welcomed back home. Once situated, he 
straightway began to dedicated time to serving alongside his brothers 
and sisters in arms, just as he did during his youth; in addition to a 
rather novel idea. As Dathomir was now apart of the United Clans' 
territory, Isley thought it necessary to collaborated with the natives 
of the world in order to form a mutually beneficial relationship. 
Surprisingly, the Mother Superior of the world, Petra Cavataio, thought 
similarly. A meeting between the two, in which the Mother Superior 
inquired about Isley's skills, ultimately resulted in one of the most 
surprising turn of events...Isley's adoption into the Petra's own family
 as her son.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#daa520"><span style="font-family:georgia, serif"><strong>The Fall</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
There came a time when Isley Verd stood on an intersection between three
 worlds: the nation that his wife and children called home, the culture 
that had reared and cultivated him from birth, and a new life as the son
 of Petra. For him, the simple reality is that all three are possess 
infinite value...resulting in a single goal: a heartfelt desire to be 
strong enough to protect them all...for a tremendous threat lurked in 
the shadows. To this end daily life was filled to the brim with pushing 
himself to the absolute limit and doing all he can for his people. His 
aim was to shed all weakness, hone all his strengths to their apex, and 
to defend that which is precious beyond words.<br><br>
However, the journey to grow strong led to diving ever deeper into the 
Dark Side of the Force. As Isley submerged himself in the darkness, he 
slowly began to lose himself. As if orchestrated by the very threat he 
hoped to one day face, a "darker" mind was born within him. Constant 
Alchemical creations and prolonged exposure to the purest Darkness 
allowed this entity, Darth Metus, to seize control. He wrested control 
of the body from Isley's hands and left the Mandalorian as but a 
spectator to the travesties that would soon follow.<br><br>
Grabs at power were made. Political maneuvering was achieved. The Design
 of the enemy had been realized, resulting in Darth Metus' rapid 
ascension within the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In those days, 
he was easily one of the most powerful individuals in the whole 
nation...and he used this position to spark a war. Seeminly overnight, 
the Omega Protectorate launched an invasion against the Confederacy; 
instigated by none other than the "dark mind" himself. This, in turn, 
created a civil war within the nation, leading to the collapse of all 
that had been established.<br><br>
In the process, billions of lives had been lost.<br><br>
The catastrophe eventually became known as "the Fall" and ultimately 
resulted in Isley's ousting from the Southern Systems. Rank, title, and 
all mentions in recorded history were wiped clean. During this time, 
Darth Metus managed to evade capture at the hands of the Confederacy's 
new incarnation: the Abrion Systems Authority. However, his retreat 
exposed all of his worldy possessions to those with avarice rooted deep 
in their minds. The ill-wrought artifacts that had contributed to Metus'
 birth were swiftly heisted...and the time spent on the run contributed 
to Isley's recovery of his body.<br><br>
The fight was not an easy one. It took every ounce of strength the 
Mandalorian could muster to lock away the "demon"...yet he could never 
actually slay it. Darth Metus was simply too powerful to be eradicated 
once and for all; and even persists to the present.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#daa520"><span style="font-family:georgia, serif"><strong>Reconstruction: The Present</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
With literally nothing left in the entire Galaxy, Isley made his way 
back to where his story began. Only atonement for the weakness which led
 to so much loss characterizes him at present; and his daily life is 
spent searching for the pieces of his former happiness. To date, he has 
cut all ties with the darker organizations of the Galaxy and wholly 
devoted himself to the United Clans of Mandalore. His goal is to bring 
pride to his people, restore honor to his clan, and to rebuild his 
shattered life one piece at a time.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Yet this, like all things, will not be easy...but if it was, would it be worth doing?</p>
