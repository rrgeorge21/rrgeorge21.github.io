<font color="lightblue">Description:</font> The Defender-class light corvette was produced by the Rendili Vehicle Corporation for 
the Jedi Order during the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Manufactured on Corellia, the 
Defender-class light corvette was modeled after a similar consumer corvette that was inspired by the Republic Military's Thranta-
class corvette, but the Defender-class was modified specifically for use by Jedi as a mobile operations base and a capable 
starfighter in its own right. The corvette could be flown by a single pilot, and it was equipped with heavy shielding, two sets of 
dual laser cannons, and missiles. The ship's interior was laid out over two decks, and a secure holoterminal, transceiver, multiple 
conference rooms, and a medbay were among the vessel's numerous amenities. The Defender-class saw use by the Jedi throughout the 
Cold War and the Galactic War with the Empire, and several of the Order's greatest heroes flew Defender-class corvettes on their 
adventures across the galaxy. At least one corvette survived to the time of the Galactic Civil War, when agents of the Alliance to 
Restore the Republic stole the vessel and used it on one of their missions.<br>

Characteristics<br><br>

Physical Appearance<br><br>

The Defender-class light corvette was specifically designed by the Rendili Vehicle Corporation for use by the Jedi Order, as the 
Jedi Council believed that traditional vessels of the Republic Military were unsuited to use by Jedi on many of their missions. 
The Order imagined the new vessel to be a mobile base of operations that was fast, maneuverable, and well-armed. Rendili based 
the exterior design of the Defender-class on a consumer model corvette, which itself was devised after the Republic Navy's 
Thranta-class corvette, but the ship underwent considerable upgrades and retrofits that distanced itself from the civilian model. 
Rendili specifically designed the vessel's color scheme of red and white to create a vessel that would inspire fear in the 
Republic's enemies and instantly announce the presence of a Jedi on battlefields across the galaxy.<br><br>

Measuring seventy-nine meters wide and ninety-four meters long, the Defender-class was twenty-nine meters tall when resting on its 
four landing gear. The frontal hull of the corvette was curved at an angle that deflected enemy laser fire easily, and two sets of 
twin laser cannons were situated at either end of the bow, while the corvette's bridge was located in the center between the ship's 
main running lights. The main body of the ship was roughly in the shape of a triangular figure-eight, with the rear of the ship 
sporting two access hatches on either side and the corvette's twin thrusters situated at the end of the vessel. The access hatches 
were situated on either side of the main conference room, with the sensor array and communications dish located on the exterior of 
the vessel above the conference room. The primary boarding ramp was located in the center of the corvette's lower hull and opened 
out beneath the ship's bridge. The Defender-class corvette was equipped with high-powered deflector shields for defense, while the 
ship's missile launchers allowed it to take on enemy vessels of far greater size and strength.<br><br>

Interior Layout<br><br>

Intended as a mobile operations center for the members of the Jedi Order, the Defender-class corvette's interior was laid out in 
two decks. The upper level contained the ship's bridge, the primary conference room, a smaller secondary conference room, and 
living accommodations for the ship's crew as well as a single escape pod. The bridge could be manned by a maximum of five crew 
members or a minimum of one, and the ship's holographic navicomputer was situated in the center of the bridge for easy access and 
visibility. The smaller conference room and the living chambers were located on either side of the bridge, and the central chamber 
provided access to the lower level, escape pod, and the other rooms of the upper level. The conference room itself was equipped 
with the ship's primary holocomm system, the centerpiece of the spacious room. The second level was laid out in four rooms: a 
medical bay, a cargo hold, engine room, and a central access chamber. Each Defender-class corvette also featured a C2-N2 factotum 
droid, which served as the vessel's steward and ensured that the ship remained in good condition.<br><br>

Role<br><br>

The Defender-class light corvette was intended to serve as a base of operations for Jedi on assignment throughout the galaxy, and 
as such the vessel could fill a variety of roles. The starship's amenities and conference rooms allowed Jedi to carry out 
important diplomatic negotiations between parties on neutral ground, and the Defender-class's powerful weapons and defense 
systems allowed it to serve as a starfighter, in which skilled pilots could take on far larger capital ships.<br><br>

History<br><br>

Starship of the Jedi<br><br>

<font color="turquoise">"I already have one of our best starships waiting for you at the spaceport. Your astromech droid is 
prepping it for takeoff."<br>
-General Suthra</font><br><br>

The Defender-class corvette was first developed by the Rendili Vehicle Corporation at the Jedi Order's request during the Great 
Galactic War, a conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. The prototype, the Vanguard, was entering flight-
test stage around 3660 BBY on the planet Corellia, and a Human Jedi pilot was sent to Rendili's corporate facility to test the 
vessel when the ship was stolen by the Mirialan smuggler Hylo Visz. Visz's ship, the Crimson Fleece, had just been pilfered by 
her traitorous crew, and the Mirialan managed to sneak aboard the Vanguard and knock out the Jedi pilot before the Human noticed 
her presence. Visz escaped with the vessel and continued to use it throughout the rest of the Great Galactic War, leading a 
contingent of smugglers to break the Imperial-sponsored Mandalorian blockade of the Hydian Way trade route at the helm of the 
Vanguard. Despite that setback, the Defender-class corvettes went into production on Corellia by the time of the Cold War, 
which followed the Great Galactic War.<br><br>

In 3643 BBY, Republic General Var Suthra arranged for a Defender-class corvette to be delivered to Docking Bay 74 of the Coruscant 
Spaceport on the Republic's capital of Coruscant. The ship was a gift to a Jedi Knight, the former apprentice of Jedi Master 
Orgus Din, for use during the military crisis that had arisen when the Sith Lord Darth Angral declared war on the Republic using 
stolen superweapons in order to avenge the death of his son, Tarnis, at the hands of that Jedi Knight. The Knight and the astromech 
droid T7-O1, accompanied by the Jedi's new Padawan, Kira Carsen, utilized the vessel to travel the galaxy and foil Angral's plans, 
and the trio continued to use the ship as the Galactic War broke out with the Sith Empire�by which time the Knight was known as the 
Hero of Tython.<br><br>

Around the same time, Jedi Master Syo Bakarn requested another Defender-class, which he gave to a Jedi Consular, the former student 
of Master Yuon Par, so that the Consular could investigate the recent string of Force-induced plagues of madness that had been 
afflicting Jedi Masters across the galaxy. After the resolution of that crisis, the Consular was made a Jedi Master and given 
the title of Barsen'thor, or Warden of the Order. A Jedi Master piloted a Defender-class corvette while leading a Republic border 
patrol during the Cold War, but the patrol was lured to the remote Mugaar system and destroyed there.<br><br>

The Barsen'thor's vessel later became the host of the head representatives of the Rift Alliance, a splinter government that Supreme 
Chancellor Dorian Janarus was attempting to convince to rejoin the Republic. The Barsen'thor played host to the Rift Alliance's 
representatives while aiding their planets as the war with the Empire began anew, and later utilized it during a hunt for the 
mysterious agents of the Sith Emperor known as the Children of the Emperor. At the same time, the Hero of Tython and crew utilized 
their Defender-class corvette on their mission to capture the Emperor, though the group's mission later changed to preventing the 
Emperor's agents from beginning a dark side ritual that would consume all life in the galaxy.<br><br>

<font color="lightblue">Note:</font> The  Raptor is the culmination and combination of three Acclimator-class 
battleships combined into a new class of battleship - the Myrmidon-class. This battleship has been assigned to 
Black Talon Fleet as the Command vessel with Commander Dervex Cragg as the new captain after Commander 
San's demise. The fleet is still forming from parts broken off of Second Fleet as crew members and troops can 
be spared to fill it. Black Talon is to be used as a special assualt fleet that not only collects supples for the entire 
fleet, but takes on missions of vital importance such as the capture of additional ships and collection of special 
needs items (crew, gear, prisoners, etc.) as dictated by High Command or Fleet Admiral Drayson. The fleet may 
also be used as support for Special Ops Teams when needed.<br><br>

<font color="lightblue">Description:</font> As the Clone Wars raged across the galaxy, star systems found themselves 
subject to raids and attacks by one side or another, and couldn't count on the fleets to defend them against attack. Many 
systems bought starfighters, leading to the success of the Z-95 Headhunter and Y-Wing fighters, but some systems 
manufactured their own vessels.<br>
Corellia purchased the rights to build the Eta-2 Actis interceptor to defend it's system, however this fighter had a well 
earned reputation for being near uncontrolable by anyone apart from a Jedi, so Corellian Engineering reworked the design. 
Adding improved flight control computers to aid the pilot, energy shielding to protect the fragile hull, and a inbuilt 
hyperdrive, the starfighter was more expensive, but actually far more capable in battle than the interceptor it was based on.<br>
The spaceframe is basically the same, but larger solar panels to meet the power demands of the added systems, and a 
move of the droid socket to a more traditional placing behind the pilot as well as an increased hull volume to incorporate 
the systems, leave the fighter with its own distinctive look.<br>

<font color="lightblue">Capsule:</font> The Enchanter originally started life as an archaic Czerka DF-20 Medium Transport modified with 
the best technology the galaxy had to offer at the time. Moon-Zhag decided that a face-lift was in order and so the work began. With the 
finest sublight and hyperdrive engines money could buy, heavy hull armor, powerful shield generators, military specification sensors and 
a range of weaponry matching front line combat vessels, the Stiletto is a vessel to be feared by all who meet it in combat. Apart from the 
obvious turbolaserlaser cannons and four laser cannon blisters on the front of the ship, all other weapons are concealed, helping the 
vessel avoid weapons restrictions and suspicious eyes; with the two torpedo launchers popping up from hatches on the ships' sides.<br><br>

Note that the underfin actually slides back and then flips up for landing position, looking much like the Old Republic fighters from the 
Clone Wars.<br><br>

<font color="lightblue">Stealth Features</font><br><br>

Matte-black fiberplast that rendered it almost invisible against a background of stars (+1D added to visually locate the ship).<br>
Experimental gravitic modulator designed to defeat mass-detectors (already added to maneuver rating).<br>
A suite of sensor negators (adds +1D to Sensor rolls to detect the ship).<br>
Special sublight engines retooled to burn a special tibanna isotope, designated TibannaX, whose efflux turned dark a millisecond after fusion 
(move rate of 9).<br>
Viewports utilized blast-tinting technology.<br><br>

Ships in the Class: BTS Enchanter (lead ship), BTS Sorcerer and the BTS Necromancer. The remaining ships: BTS Warlock, BTS Pyromancer, BTS 
Chieftain, BTS Angry Angel, BTS The Red Tide, BTS Praying Mantis and the BTS Stiletto will be added as more can be located and modified.<br><br>

<font color="lightblue">Description:</font><br>
<u>Dimensions:</u><br>
A stock ship was 1,137 meters long, making it one of the largest capital ships capable of atmospheric operations, landing on planets to load and unload troops and vehicles.<br><br>

The Venator-class was born from the success of the Acclamator-class assault ship and was designed by Lira Blissex for the purpose of serving as a medium-sized, versatile multi-role warship.<br><br>

<u>Roles:</u><br>
A Venator-class Star Destroyer above Coruscant.While designed primarily for ship-to-ship combat, the Venator had secondary roles 
ranging from starfighter carrier, to military transport and battleship escort. The expanded carrier role made the Venator-class 
popular amongst Jedi starfighter aces. As a popular multi-role warship of the Republic Navy, the Venator was considered heavily 
armed and armored enough to lead assaults on Rim worlds like Utapau as well as fast enough to chase down blockade runners.<br><br>

These vessels also sported the red color of diplomatic immunity all Republic ships sported; by the beginning of the Galactic 
Empire, the hulls were deprived of this symbol of the Republic, giving them a dull gray appearance.<br><br>

<u>Offensive and Defensive Systems:</u><br>
The armament of a single Venator-class Star Destroyer consisted of 8 DBY-827 heavy dual turbolaser turrets, 2 medium dual 
turbolaser cannons, 52 point-defense dual laser cannons, and 4 heavy proton torpedo tubes.<br><br>

The Venator-class's eight heavy dual turbolaser turrets were its main weapons and had two tracking modes. In its precise, 
long-range tracking mode, the DBY-827 could hit a target vessel at a range of 10 light minutes. During close-range fights, the 
turrets could rotate in three seconds with their fast-tracking mode. In terms of firepower, these weapons rivaled the main 
battery on the later Imperial-class Star Destroyers.<br><br>

The DBY-827 had seven different power settings. This allowed the Venator's pilots and gunners to select a range of destruction, 
from a small strike to a vaporizing blow. As a true warship, the Venator-class Star Destroyer could divert almost all of its 
reactor output to its heavy turbolasers when needed. As a result of this, a flotilla of these could break through the shields of 
a Trade Federation warship with ease.<br><br>

At the suggestion of Anakin Skywalker, a heavy SPHA turbolaser cannon was installed within the ventral hangar bay of some 
Venator-class ships of the Open Circle Fleet. These weapons were meant to protect the Star Destroyers while they opened their 
long ventral doors to the army complement bays. They would be used to considerable effect during the Battle of Coruscant.<br><br>

At least some Venator-class ships also included heavy turbolaser batteries situated along the dividing middle trench.<br><br>

<u>Propulsion Systems:</u><br>
Venators were equipped with powerful engines, a Class 1 hyperdrive with an effective range of 60,000 light-years. Its main 
reactor could annihilate up to 40,000 tons of hypermatter fuel per second, producing 3.6 � 1024 watts of power.<br><br>

<u>Complement:</u><br>
Despite possessing powerful weaponry and being on par with the Victory-class, the Venator-class was designed with an additional 
starfighter carrier role in mind. Its hangar bays were far larger than those on other Star Destroyers like the Victory-class and 
later models like the Imperator-class.<br><br>

Prior to the formation of the Galactic Empire, a typical Republic Venator carried a complement of 420 fighters: 192 V-wing or V-19 Torrent starfighters, 192 Eta-2 Actis-class 
interceptors, and 36 ARC-170 starfighters. The ship also typically maintained a variety of shuttles in its hangars. Since it was capable of entering a planet's atmosphere and landing 
on its surface, the pre-Imperial Venator-class had a standard complement of 40 LAAT/i gunships and 24 military walkers for planetary operations.<br><br>

In addition to a standard ventral hangar bay, the bow of a Venator could open up to reveal a half kilometer long dorsal flight 
deck. This flight deck enabled the Venator-class to rapidly launch hundreds of fighters. However, the slow opening and closing 
of the armored bow doors could leave the ship extremely vulnerable.<br><br>

Although strong shielding was used to compensate for this weakness, this design aspect would be entirely omitted from later Star 
Destroyer designs, such as the Imperator-class. On ships in the Open Circle Fleet, a SPHA turbolaser cannon was positioned near 
the ventral hangar opening for the purpose of protecting the ship along the ventral arc. The Venator-class also had 
hangar-openings on its port and starboard side. These were used to dock with space stations, mooring towers, and larger 
starships, for the purpose of transferring troops and materials.<br><br>

<u>Bridge:</u><br>
Because of its carrier role, the Venator-class featured a novel dual bridge tower design. The port tower was the starfighter command bridge, while the 
starboard tower served as a standard helm and command bridge. On future designs, this dual bridge design was also employed.<br><br>

The command bridge was designed with dual crew pits where operators would be stationed to control the ship's various functions. 
Officers would patrol walkways above and have a panoramic view to the outside. This bridge design would become a standard feature 
on most Imperial warships.<br><br>

<u>History:</u><br>
Venator-class Star Destroyers were deployed in many battles during the middle and late Clone Wars, most notably during the Battle of 
Coruscant when upwards of a thousand such ships helped protect the capital, and played pivotal roles in the repulsion of the CIS forces 
and the rescue of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.<br><br>

These warships were fast enough to pursue blockade runners, while also being large enough to lead independent operations, such 
as the Battle of Kashyyyk and the Battle of Utapau. They could be used to land troops on planetary surfaces, and as escorts for 
battleships, but their primary role was as combat warships and starfighter carriers.<br><br>

By the end of the Clone Wars, it had become the most popular capital ship of the Republic, although shortly after the formation 
of the New Order, it was eclipsed by designs inspired by the Victory II-class. Imperial Venator-class Star Destroyers lacked the 
colorful markings of the Republic and were used to great effect in the early Empire.<br><br>

Eventually, more robust vessels such as the Imperator- and Tector-classes became favored, and the Venator and its variants were 
gradually phased out. Still, they continued to serve the Empire, albeit on an apparently reduced level.<br><br>

After the end of the Clone Wars, many Venators were abandoned and left to drift in space. Several of these vessels fell into the 
hands of the Mandalorians, the Zann Consortium, and various pirate groups. By this time, the vessel was considered obsolete, but 
was available to buy from several merchants.<br><br>

<font color="lightblue">Description:</font> The Delta-class DX-9 stormtrooper transport was an assault vehicle, built by Telgorn 
Corporation, which was designed to carry Imperial stormtroopers into battle.<br><br>

<u>Characteristics:</u><br> 
An older design of the DX-9, also found throughout the galaxy.The Delta-class DX-9 was armed with eight laser cannons, four ion 
cannons, and two projectile launchers that were usually loaded with proton torpedoes. These weapons allowed the DX-9 to disable 
and board targets with light to moderate defenses. Very strong shielding, particularly forward of the vessel, allowed the 
transport to weather considerable resistance from its targets. A universal docking mechanism allowed the DX-9 to attach itself 
to most ships, and the transport could also bore its own hole into the enemy hull, if necessary.<br><br>

The DX-9 only had weapons on its forward arc, and was not very maneuverable, so it was vulnerable to starfighter attacks. These 
transports were usually deployed with fighter escorts or as part of a larger assault force.<br><br>

<u>History</u><br>
The stormtrooper transport saw a great deal of action during the Galactic Civil War, not only for boarding operations and 
deploying troops into battle, but also as a personnel transport for use between starships. It also could be used to resupply 
bombers and repair other craft. Omega and Sigma were notable Imperial teams of DX-9s that participated in many missions.<br><br>

Although designed for the Galactic Empire, many DX-9 were also often used by other factions, most notably the Rebel Alliance.<br><br>

The Empire eventually developed a successor to the Delta-class, the Gamma-class ATR-6 assault transport. The larger ATR-6 
lacked frontal laser cannons, instead having laser turrets to cover firing arcs that were blind spots on the DX-9. The Imperial 
Navy continued to use the Delta-class for most assault and boarding operations, turning to the Gamma-class if especially heavy 
opposition was expected. A further development was the Beta-class ETR-3 escort transport which combined the DX-9's frontal 
weaponry with the ATR-6's turrets.<br><br>

In 6 ABY, one of these transports was deployed by the forces of Admiral Devlia, based on Vladet, against Rogue Squadron's base 
on Talasea. Following the failure of that surprise covert assault, the transport was captured by New Republic forces. In 10 ABY 
during the Battle of Altyr V, DX-9s deployed stormtroopers against the New Republic base on Altyr V.

<font color="lightblue">Description:</font><br>
<u>Dimensions:</u><br>
The 752-meter-long Acclamator I-class assault transport carried thousands of Republic clone troopers into battle. The 
Acclamator I favored a wedge or dagger shaped design, like the Republic warships during the Mandalorian Wars, due to its 
effectiveness�it allowed concentration of firepower while minimizing target profile. This basic design was used in a number of 
larger craft predating it and would define Imperial ships for decades to come.<br><br>

<u>Offensive and Defensive Systems:</u><br>
These ships were armed with 4 heavy torpedo launch tubes; 24 point-defense laser cannons, rated at 6 megatons per shot; and 12 quad turbolaser turrets, each rated at a maximum of 200 
gigatons per shot.<br><br>

Groups of these ships could perform a "Base Delta Zero", an orbital bombardment that would exterminate all life on the planet. 
The later Acclamator II-class could also serve as star frigates to support their landing groups. In addition to ground landings, 
Acclamator-class ships were capable of water landings, as displayed at the Battle of Mon Calamari.<br><br>

The sensor and communications suites were located at the front of the ship's command tower.<br><br>

Hull armor of Acclamator-class vessels was impregnated with ultra-dispersive neutronium that withstood and spread massive energy 
blasts. Fusion rockets fired by enemy forces barely made a scratch on the hull as a result.<br><br>

<u>Complement:</u><br>
Acclamator I-class ships also carried support equipment and vehicles, such as AT-TE and SPHA walkers, used to provide clone 
troopers with heavy battlefield support.<br><br> 

Each Acclamator I-class ship held 320 speeder bikes, used by clone troopers for fast battlefield reconnaissance and patrol 
duties. Eighty LAAT gunships were carried to insert personnel, vehicles, and cargo into battle zones in addition to providing 
close air support.<br><br>

Gunships were suspended along an overhead circulating rail in the upper hangar for maintenance procedures during travels. A 
lower, smaller hangar area was used to embark and disembark ground troops and material when landed. The two levels were 
connected with elevator platforms. Most of the passenger and barrack decks were located on the upper levels of an 
Acclamator-class ship.<br><br>

<u>Propulsion Systems:</u><br>
The Acclamator-class's main reactor was located in the middle of the vessel, inside the main superstructure, and was preceded 
at the frontal half of the ship by multiple fuel tanks. The tanks compressed hypermatter to enormous density for storage. The 
tanks were connected to the main reactor via pipe assemblies. Secondary reactors were located towards the bow of the vessel.<br><br>

The ship's main thrusters were fitted with eight electromagnetic rudders that deflected the exhaust particle streams and gave 
boosts when turning the ship. The secondary thrusters did not provide as much power, but were useful for maneuvering due to 
being placed further away from the ship's main axis.<br><br>

The massive fin at the stern of the Acclamator-class contained both the anti-gravity generator and the ship's hyperdrive 
generator. When landed, the repulsorlift carried much of the ship's weight, but the landing legs maintained a stabile contact 
with the ground.<br><br>

<u>Bridge:</u><br>
The bridge was located in the middle of an arrow-shaped command tower module that protruded from the dorsal superstructure. 
This tower module was a standard design for smaller ships in Kuat Drive Yards's starship catalogue, which Rothana supplied 
vessels to. The main bridge and command center had no windows but relied upon advanced holoscreens. The bridge crew usually 
consisted of fully-armored clone pilots manning the control panels.<br><br>

<u>History</u><br><br>
 
<u>Preceding Designs:</u><br>
An older design saw duty as a warship in the years prior to the Invasion of Naboo. These ships also had a sleek shape and some 
of their top armor was removed to make room for massive turbolasers. Another design, and possibly a direct predecessor to the 
Acclamator itself, was seen in an important system performing fleet-maneuvers with other warships, sometime after 32 BBY.<br><br>

<u>Republic Origin:</u><br>
In their first engagement at the Battle of Geonosis, the Acclamator I-class proved pivotal in the Republic victory, delivering 
legions of clone troopers to the battlefield while a large Republic fleet engaged the Separatist fleet in orbit. Just after the 
Battle of Geonosis, the Republic ordered 1,000 more of them. At least as of 21 BBY, all Acclamators were completely crewed by 
clones.<br><br>

Near the end of the Clone Wars, a more updated version, the Acclamator II-class assault ship, was put into production. The two 
subclasses saw many battles in both the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War. Other Kuati designs complemented and supplanted 
the Acclamator-class, but the design was popular enough to continue service for decades.<br><br>

<u>Later Service:</u><br>
Several variants of the Acclamator design appeared to be dedicated for space combat rather than planetary assault. Its design 
was also influential on the development of several other warships. One example was the Class II Frigate, represented by Rand 
Ecliptic, which had a more narrow hullform and two docking bays with port and starboard openings. There was no large downward-
facing hangar bay as seen on some of the early Acclamator-class ships, but there were large retractable loading ramps in order 
for the clone troopers to board.<br><br>

In addition to being a warship and a military transport, some Imperial Acclamators were used as slave ships, transporting large 
quantities of enslaved people to various Imperial penal colonies during the Galactic Civil War. Although they were initially 
not considered "Star Destroyers", the Acclamator-class would sometimes be referred to as such during the reign of the Empire. 
Some would fall into the hands of criminal groups such as the Zann Consortium.<br><br>

<font color="lightblue">Description:</font> The Delta-class DX-9 stormtrooper transport was an assault vehicle, built by Telgorn 
Corporation, which was designed to carry Imperial stormtroopers into battle.<br><br>

<u>Characteristics:</u><br> 
An older design of the DX-9, also found throughout the galaxy.The Delta-class DX-9 was armed with eight laser cannons, four ion 
cannons, and two projectile launchers that were usually loaded with proton torpedoes. These weapons allowed the DX-9 to disable 
and board targets with light to moderate defenses. Very strong shielding, particularly forward of the vessel, allowed the 
transport to weather considerable resistance from its targets. A universal docking mechanism allowed the DX-9 to attach itself 
to most ships, and the transport could also bore its own hole into the enemy hull, if necessary.<br><br>

The DX-9 only had weapons on its forward arc, and was not very maneuverable, so it was vulnerable to starfighter attacks. These 
transports were usually deployed with fighter escorts or as part of a larger assault force.<br><br>

<u>History</u><br>
The stormtrooper transport saw a great deal of action during the Galactic Civil War, not only for boarding operations and 
deploying troops into battle, but also as a personnel transport for use between starships. It also could be used to resupply 
bombers and repair other craft. Omega and Sigma were notable Imperial teams of DX-9s that participated in many missions.<br><br>

Although designed for the Galactic Empire, many DX-9 were also often used by other factions, most notably the Rebel Alliance.<br><br>

The Empire eventually developed a successor to the Delta-class, the Gamma-class ATR-6 assault transport. The larger ATR-6 
lacked frontal laser cannons, instead having laser turrets to cover firing arcs that were blind spots on the DX-9. The Imperial 
Navy continued to use the Delta-class for most assault and boarding operations, turning to the Gamma-class if especially heavy 
opposition was expected. A further development was the Beta-class ETR-3 escort transport which combined the DX-9's frontal 
weaponry with the ATR-6's turrets.<br><br>

In 6 ABY, one of these transports was deployed by the forces of Admiral Devlia, based on Vladet, against Rogue Squadron's base 
on Talasea. Following the failure of that surprise covert assault, the transport was captured by New Republic forces. In 10 ABY 
during the Battle of Altyr V, DX-9s deployed stormtroopers against the New Republic base on Altyr V.

<font color="lightblue">Description:</font> The Liberator Class Cruiser is a small capital ship which serves as a major starfighter transport platform for the 
Rebellion and New Republic. Capable of carrying 6 full squadrons and their support staff, and three full regiments of troops, the 
Liberator is a powerful and effective platform for launching assaults. However it is a weakly armed vessel, and although it can 
match any non-military vessel for speed and combat effectiveness, it is a poor match for Imperial Military vessels, requiring a 
number of defence craft to perform in fleet engagements. The Liberator Class was provided to the Rebellion by SoroSuub towards the 
end of the reign of Emperor Palpatine, and became one of the first custom-built Rebel Starships, serving with distinction alongside 
the retrofitted Mon Calimari Cruisers and stolen Nebulon-B frigates, becoming a major boost to Rebel legitimacy as a power capable 
of challenging the Empire. Liberators continue to serve the New Republic and look set to last for a long time yet, even though new 
vessels of this class are no longer manufactured.<br><br>

<font color="lightblue">Description:</font> The Nebulon-B Frigate was introduced by the Imperial Navy to deal with the increasing problem 
of Rebel Starfighter attacks on convoys and fleets, however the vessel suffered from underpowered engines and weapons both of which allowed 
Rebel Starfighters to outmanuever and threaten these capital ships. The Nebulon-B Heavy Frigate is an upgrade to the original design which 
was sold as new and also performed as a refit to already operational Nebulon-B's, and consisted of the addition of a new engine section 
mounted to the bottom of the current engine housing, and connected to the forward hull by an additional spar. As well as providing an 
increased sublight speed, the engines provided far more power which allowed the vessel to be upgraded in a number of other ways including 
upgraded anti starfighter weaponry as well as an all round increase in the number of weapons carried by the vessel. Other upgrades included 
increased hyperdrive speed, boosted shielding and increased manueverability, all of which made the vessel the threat to Rebel Starfighter 
attacks that the original vessel was intended to be. The Galactic Empire bought a number of these vessel, and planned to upgrade already 
operational Nebulon-B's to this standard, but the Battle of Endor and the financial difficulties that the Empire was plunged into 
afterwards meant that this never happened and the Nebulon-B Heavy Frigate never became as common as intended.<br><br>

<font color="lightblue">Description:</font> Similar in length and armament to the Nebulon-B Frigate. This ship is better equiped to defend against starfighters and missiles, but can hold its own against smaller capitol ships. KDY decided to step away from the Nebulon-B design and try a completely new shape to see if it could hold up against some of the other types of ships in the same category. The design did not do as well as expected, but it is solid and well put together. They are now regular sellers to militaries throughout the galaxy.<br><br>

modular design and could be configured for cargo transport, passenger liner service, or even military duty. The 
Corellian Corvette was so common among legitimate shipping, passenger, and government interests that many 
pirates and smugglers had taken to using it for their own purposes.<br><br>

The CR-92 is what Corellian Engineering Corporation advertised as THE Corellian Corvette. Adequately armed and

<font color="turquoise">"I don't think we can protect two transports at a time."<br>
-General Rieekan</font><br><br>

The GR-75 medium transport, also known as the Gallofree medium transport or Rebel transport, was a clamshell-hulled transport produced by Gallofree Yards, Inc. Many of these transports served the Alliance Fleet during the Galactic Civil War, including playing a pivotal role in the evacuation of the Rebellion's Echo Base during the Battle of Hoth.<br><br>

Characteristics<br><br>

A sister design to the civilian GR-45 model, the GR-75 was used by freight drivers and shipping firms to haul cargo.<br><br>

The transport's outer hull was like a thick shell with the interior entirely open for cargo pods. This open-space design could fit up to 19,000 metric tons of cargo into the 90 meter long ship. Modular cargo pods greatly sped up the loading and unloading process.<br><br>

When the transport was at its cargo capacity, a magnetic shield locked the modules in place, while at the same time kept out the vacuum of space. The factory model included space for forty passengers, but almost all ships traded it for increased cargo storage.<br><br>

Focused entirely on maximizing cargo space, GR-75 transports were armed with four turreted twin laser cannons, a deflector shield produced by the shield generator pod above the stern, a meager Class 4 hyperdrive, and a sublight engine array capable of achieving a top atmospheric speed of 650 kilometers per hour. While inexpensive, the GR-75 was notorious for its high maintenance requirements.
Some of these transports were used as shuttles for high ranking Rebel Alliance personnel.<br><br>

History<br><br>

The design proved popular with Galactic Republic forces, and the ships were used as resupply vessels during the Clone Wars.<br><br>

The Galactic Empire used at least one known unit, the Shackles of Nizon, which saw service as a slave ship.<br><br>

Many GR-75 transports were acquired by the Rebel Alliance due to their low cost and ready access to spare parts. The transports had hulls impenetrable by imperial sensors and were additionally equipped with sensor jammers, making them undetectable to Imperial sensors, thus reducing the chances of Imperials detecting Rebel supply runs. Not intended for combat, GR-75s were commonly placed at the center of Alliance fleet formations and relied on starfighter support in blockade-running missions. After Gallofree Yards went bankrupt in 3 BBY, the majority of the remaining stock of ships found its way into the Alliance fleet.<br><br>

Several GR-75 transports were part of a fleet led by the Salvation in 1 BBY. The fleet was attacked by Boba Fett, who was trying to capture Juno Eclipse. The fleet then jumped to Kamino on the order of General Rahm Kota to take out the Timira City Cloning Facility. After the battle, several GR-75s were used as decoys while the imprisoned Darth Vader was taken to the Dantooine base aboard the Rogue Shadow.<br><br>

One of the GR-75's most famous actions was the evacuation of Rebel personnel during the Battle of Hoth. More than half of the GR-75s were destroyed, as the Imperial blockade proved too much for the Rebel defenses, though thirteen escaped safely, due to the escort afforded by the X-wings of Rogue Squadron, as well as the covering fire provided by the V-150 anti-orbital ion cannon.<br><br>

The Alliance used the GR-75s for almost any purpose they could find and the ships became so ubiquitous that they became commonly known as Rebel medium transports. They were primarily used to transport supplies, equipment, and troops. Some were modified to be fuel tankers for long range starfighter missions or for smaller ships. They also were used as kamikaze vessels, as demonstrated during the assault on the Fondor shipyards and the Battle of Endor, where they functioned as fire ships and were loaded with explosives.<br><br>

Several vessels fell into the hands of the Hutt Cartel who used them to land troops and attack vehicles on Hypori for the Ground Battle on Hypori.<br><br>

<font color="lightblue">Description:</font> The DP20 frigate or Corellian Gunship was one of the few dedicated warship designs produced by Corellian Engineering Corporation, and was the most common member of the Corellian gunship product line. Though small and compact, it was fast and carried heavy firepower for a ship of its size and class.<br><br>

Characteristics<br><br>

Unlike its cousin, the CR90 corvette, the gunship had minimal cargo space and almost no space for passengers or troops. These small ships were designed to be only two things: fast and deadly. Engines consumed nearly half of the gunship's interior space. What little room was left was used for deflector shield generators and weapons.<br><br>

Armed with eight double turbolaser cannons, four concussion missile tubes, and six quad laser cannons, the Corellian gunship was effective against both larger capital ships as well as starfighters, though it was primarily used against the latter. These ships were 120 meters longc. Each one carried a crew of 45, along with 46 gunners. They were equipped with Class 2 hyperdrives.<br><br>

History<br><br>

The DP20 was originally designed for the fleet of the Galactic Republic. These vessels saw extensive use among the Corellian and Rebel Alliance/New Republic fleets, although some were also seen in the hands of independent operators, such as pirate factions and other fringe groups. Local Imperial forces also utilized the class. The Rebel Alliance, in need of a small, fast attack vessel, decided to purchase a few of these starships after witnessing a group of pirates use them to successfully hijack an Imperial shipment guarded by several Imperial fighters and bombers. At least one of these vessels was wrecked in the Korteen asteroid belt by Quarg's father and his space wreckers.<br><br>

<font color="lightblue">Description:</font> The Defender-class light corvette was produced by the Rendili Vehicle Corporation for 
the Jedi Order during the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Manufactured on Corellia, the 
Defender-class light corvette was modeled after a similar consumer corvette that was inspired by the Republic Military's Thranta-
class corvette, but the Defender-class was modified specifically for use by Jedi as a mobile operations base and a capable 
starfighter in its own right. The corvette could be flown by a single pilot, and it was equipped with heavy shielding, two sets of 
dual laser cannons, and missiles. The ship's interior was laid out over two decks, and a secure holoterminal, transceiver, multiple 
conference rooms, and a medbay were among the vessel's numerous amenities. The Defender-class saw use by the Jedi throughout the 
Cold War and the Galactic War with the Empire, and several of the Order's greatest heroes flew Defender-class corvettes on their 
adventures across the galaxy. At least one corvette survived to the time of the Galactic Civil War, when agents of the Alliance to 
Restore the Republic stole the vessel and used it on one of their missions.<br>

Characteristics<br><br>

Physical Appearance<br><br>

The Defender-class light corvette was specifically designed by the Rendili Vehicle Corporation for use by the Jedi Order, as the 
Jedi Council believed that traditional vessels of the Republic Military were unsuited to use by Jedi on many of their missions. 
The Order imagined the new vessel to be a mobile base of operations that was fast, maneuverable, and well-armed. Rendili based 
the exterior design of the Defender-class on a consumer model corvette, which itself was devised after the Republic Navy's 
Thranta-class corvette, but the ship underwent considerable upgrades and retrofits that distanced itself from the civilian model. 
Rendili specifically designed the vessel's color scheme of red and white to create a vessel that would inspire fear in the 
Republic's enemies and instantly announce the presence of a Jedi on battlefields across the galaxy.<br><br>

Measuring seventy-nine meters wide and ninety-four meters long, the Defender-class was twenty-nine meters tall when resting on its 
four landing gear. The frontal hull of the corvette was curved at an angle that deflected enemy laser fire easily, and two sets of 
twin laser cannons were situated at either end of the bow, while the corvette's bridge was located in the center between the ship's 
main running lights. The main body of the ship was roughly in the shape of a triangular figure-eight, with the rear of the ship 
sporting two access hatches on either side and the corvette's twin thrusters situated at the end of the vessel. The access hatches 
were situated on either side of the main conference room, with the sensor array and communications dish located on the exterior of 
the vessel above the conference room. The primary boarding ramp was located in the center of the corvette's lower hull and opened 
out beneath the ship's bridge. The Defender-class corvette was equipped with high-powered deflector shields for defense, while the 
ship's missile launchers allowed it to take on enemy vessels of far greater size and strength.<br><br>

Interior Layout<br><br>

Intended as a mobile operations center for the members of the Jedi Order, the Defender-class corvette's interior was laid out in 
two decks. The upper level contained the ship's bridge, the primary conference room, a smaller secondary conference room, and 
living accommodations for the ship's crew as well as a single escape pod. The bridge could be manned by a maximum of five crew 
members or a minimum of one, and the ship's holographic navicomputer was situated in the center of the bridge for easy access and 
visibility. The smaller conference room and the living chambers were located on either side of the bridge, and the central chamber 
provided access to the lower level, escape pod, and the other rooms of the upper level. The conference room itself was equipped 
with the ship's primary holocomm system, the centerpiece of the spacious room. The second level was laid out in four rooms: a 
medical bay, a cargo hold, engine room, and a central access chamber. Each Defender-class corvette also featured a C2-N2 factotum 
droid, which served as the vessel's steward and ensured that the ship remained in good condition.<br><br>

Role<br><br>

The Defender-class light corvette was intended to serve as a base of operations for Jedi on assignment throughout the galaxy, and 
as such the vessel could fill a variety of roles. The starship's amenities and conference rooms allowed Jedi to carry out 
important diplomatic negotiations between parties on neutral ground, and the Defender-class's powerful weapons and defense 
systems allowed it to serve as a starfighter, in which skilled pilots could take on far larger capital ships.<br><br>

History<br><br>

Starship of the Jedi<br><br>

<font color="turquoise">"I already have one of our best starships waiting for you at the spaceport. Your astromech droid is 
prepping it for takeoff."<br>
-General Suthra</font><br><br>

The Defender-class corvette was first developed by the Rendili Vehicle Corporation at the Jedi Order's request during the Great 
Galactic War, a conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. The prototype, the Vanguard, was entering flight-
test stage around 3660 BBY on the planet Corellia, and a Human Jedi pilot was sent to Rendili's corporate facility to test the 
vessel when the ship was stolen by the Mirialan smuggler Hylo Visz. Visz's ship, the Crimson Fleece, had just been pilfered by 
her traitorous crew, and the Mirialan managed to sneak aboard the Vanguard and knock out the Jedi pilot before the Human noticed 
her presence. Visz escaped with the vessel and continued to use it throughout the rest of the Great Galactic War, leading a 
contingent of smugglers to break the Imperial-sponsored Mandalorian blockade of the Hydian Way trade route at the helm of the 
Vanguard. Despite that setback, the Defender-class corvettes went into production on Corellia by the time of the Cold War, 
which followed the Great Galactic War.<br><br>

In 3643 BBY, Republic General Var Suthra arranged for a Defender-class corvette to be delivered to Docking Bay 74 of the Coruscant 
Spaceport on the Republic's capital of Coruscant. The ship was a gift to a Jedi Knight, the former apprentice of Jedi Master 
Orgus Din, for use during the military crisis that had arisen when the Sith Lord Darth Angral declared war on the Republic using 
stolen superweapons in order to avenge the death of his son, Tarnis, at the hands of that Jedi Knight. The Knight and the astromech 
droid T7-O1, accompanied by the Jedi's new Padawan, Kira Carsen, utilized the vessel to travel the galaxy and foil Angral's plans, 
and the trio continued to use the ship as the Galactic War broke out with the Sith Empire�by which time the Knight was known as the 
Hero of Tython.<br><br>

Around the same time, Jedi Master Syo Bakarn requested another Defender-class, which he gave to a Jedi Consular, the former student 
of Master Yuon Par, so that the Consular could investigate the recent string of Force-induced plagues of madness that had been 
afflicting Jedi Masters across the galaxy. After the resolution of that crisis, the Consular was made a Jedi Master and given 
the title of Barsen'thor, or Warden of the Order. A Jedi Master piloted a Defender-class corvette while leading a Republic border 
patrol during the Cold War, but the patrol was lured to the remote Mugaar system and destroyed there.<br><br>

The Barsen'thor's vessel later became the host of the head representatives of the Rift Alliance, a splinter government that Supreme 
Chancellor Dorian Janarus was attempting to convince to rejoin the Republic. The Barsen'thor played host to the Rift Alliance's 
representatives while aiding their planets as the war with the Empire began anew, and later utilized it during a hunt for the 
mysterious agents of the Sith Emperor known as the Children of the Emperor. At the same time, the Hero of Tython and crew utilized 
their Defender-class corvette on their mission to capture the Emperor, though the group's mission later changed to preventing the 
Emperor's agents from beginning a dark side ritual that would consume all life in the galaxy.<br><br>
