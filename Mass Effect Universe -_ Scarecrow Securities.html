Neither of which are allied, This leads to tier 3 being a war zone, within days established lines appear. Well resistance is strong both forces slowly are depleted on both resources and manpower. Within in weeks niether stands capable of continuing the conflict this leads to the collapse of both factions. The Big three move in to claim what remains splitting the districts between one another. A small group of Syndicate Guardsmen lead by Zangeef Chang, a armorer for the Syndicate, move from there isolated outpost within former Syndicate territory to the Bacalou Skull's Geist district. Hoping to reform with other units in more friendly territory no longer being capable of holding out. The survivors reform only being 37 strong, with a few injured from breaking through enemy lines. Without capable medical attention the count becomes 32 members, week later reports come in that Syndicate is no more. This leads to there count becoming even less as Guardsmen toss aside there armor and leave, in the end only 24 remain under Zangeefs command.</li><li><b>February 2201:</b> Zangeef now in command of the small group makes a decision, no longer a part of there former group they re brand themselves mercenaries, taking on the nickname Scarecrows as a reminder of there guardsmen past. Placing there armor in storage crates they decide to hide there origins and look for jobs to keep there group alive. Hiding in a old storage building they take any jobs they find. During one job for a local gang to take out a competing gang they lose 3 members when there caught off guard by the enemy gang. With such a lose 2 more leave worried that this line of work is no good for them. By the end of the month the group is 19 strong, with such numbers and the money they made from the few jobs they scrapped togather they lay lower hoping to evade the attention of the Big Three still fearing one day there hideout would be found along with there past.</li><li><b>March 2201:</b> The small group too there surprise meets with a former member of the Syndicate who seemed to have lucky not been present during the war. A former Geist at that known as Sarah Redfield, with her unable to speak they assist her in finding jobs she can do on her own. Now and then she stops by the lend a helping hand but for the most part does not rejoin the small group. One day well a few members were out they were spotted by a former Syndicate Guardsmen turn Blue Suns merc. Identifying them to his commanding officers it leads to a shoot out as a Drunk Ralso and two other members try and fight off the group of Blue Suns. Killing the Former guardsmen but losing his two campanions, he flees back to the hideout. Soon followed by a group of Blue Suns looking for blood it leads to a shoot out as the group attempt to escape. Losing another member who stayed behind to lay a trap the Blue Suns. They find the building in flames hours later, with no one left alive. Moving to a new location they once again set up, Ralso gets in a great deal of trouble over the matter but in the end it is disregarded due to the fact they had all ready lost to many members. With only 16 members left the group continue to stay low and collect jobs just interested in trying to pass away the days. Zangeef takes up odd jobs fixing armor for other local Mercs and Bacalou Skulls members. Later that month word of the Reapers quickly spread, this leads to 3 members leaving intend on going home and protecting what they have left. The group would go quite for the Reaper conflict uninterested in fighting the war and only trying to scrap together a living.</li><li><b>April 2201:</b> A Former member who had left the group months earlier to fight the Reapers finds herself stuck in a medical bed. Having both her legs blown off well engaging Reaper forces her injuries are great and doctors suspect she has little time left. intent on living through it she passes her time wandering about her roommate who had been in Coma when she had been brought in, a Alliance officer from what she could figure. She yearned to make a friend in her final hours, maybe pass on the story of her life so at least one person would remember her, maybe even pass on word of her death to her former comrades.</li><li><b>May 2201:</b> the young officer that the former Guardsmen had waited for so long to see awaken finally awoke early in the month. After she had finally regained her senses both girls spoke of themselves, the guardsmen finding out that the officer was a rich born girl, who family had fallen on hard times and she had joined the military as she planned what to do in the future. The girl she learned was named Kamyrin Gyvolis, well her injuries had not been bad well the girls spoke for days, they found the Kamyrin was going to be discharged from the Alliance military. The guardsmen spoke to Kamyrin and attempted to advise her on what to do with her future, one the guardsmen would not be around to see. This would be probably were the seed of the Scarecrows would be placed, as the Guardsmen spoke of her days in the Syndicate and the fearsome armor. The Armor would become a great interest to Kamyrin even in a passion that would for a time be a sole objective of the young girl to find. But well it had been a great time and the two grew close together one night late into the month the Guardsmen passed away. This struck Kamyrin and would lead her on a search to find the armor intent on rebuilding it not only to make a good amount of cash but also as a way to remember the fallen Guardsmen.</li><li><b>November 2201:</b> The group would still be continuing there small time operations, taking on what ever job to continue on living. A few members would even make  mention of hoping to go to Illium to find if any other members of the Syndicate might have survived, Ralso being a prime person that sought this. But Zangeef would simply remind them they barly made enough money to feed the group, let alone travel to another world, no matter how bad it was Omega they had no were left to go. Thats the only reason such a band had stayed togather for the last few months. With the Reaper War over, they simply hoped to stay away from there enemies the Big Three. This would not go as they had hoped, once again there band would be attacked but this time by Eclipse. Intend on wiping out a small mercenary band, it was only a bonus they were former Syndicate members. But this time they had been prepared even having set up a second hideout encase of attack. Fleeing to the Trythorian District, this had all ready acted as a second place for them to act out of when handling missions but they hoped that the Eclipse mercs would simply become disinterested.</li><li><b>May 2202:</b> For months they had passed away the time in silence continuing with there regular odd jobs, anything to survive as they saw it. This month after so much time searching since her leaving medical care Kamyrin would find luck with her and for once in the past year the group of former Guardsmen would find luck themselves. Kamyrin would find Ralso in a drunk state talking of the good old days, much similar in fashion to the way they had got in trouble before. Wandering back to the Hideout he would be followed by the Armorer intent on meeting with him, she would be in for a surprise to find Zangeef and there group. At first hostile and scared worried they might once again have to flee, after a hour long discussion both groups would happily make a deal. Zangeef would hand over the armor they had stored from there Syndicate days in return they would get a job working for Kamyrin aboard her vessel the White Rose.</li><li><b>July 2202:</b> Only a month after the former Guardsmen turned mercenaries had joined the Crew of the White Rose did they find themselves in a new adventure. Well still working on Project Temple the first product that the group would make, they found themselves in a bind. Well on Omega the younger Gyvolis siblings had gone out shopping and found themselves surrounded by a local gang. Interested in trying to sell the girls on the slave market they were taken. Not only did this send Kamyrin into a rare rage, it also send the new White Rose group into a panic. Zangeef, Ralso and a few other Guardsman taken on the former armor of there Syndicate days, lunched a all out attack on the gang. Hunting for the girls, they finally found them after having left quite a mess in there tracks, well heading back to this ship they also found themselves in a new bind. The Blue Suns did not take a liking to Syndicate armor even making a appearance in there area and attacked the group. Well no one died the group for a few months stayed away from Omega not intending to fight the Blue Suns. After that little miss adventure the Younger Gyvolis siblings grew closer to there crew members Zangeef and Ralso, making the crew almost into one big family. They would start up working doing training with the Gyvolis siblings teaching them to defend themselves. During this trip they would also gain a new member Sarah who would become Kamyrins loyal bodyguard and even a friend.</li><li><b>December 2202:</b> This month would prove to be the biggest stride in the White Rose crew becoming a true business, though later the funds would be turned towards building them into a PMC, that would not be decided tell far later. This month would mark the creation of the Phase 1 Temple series armor, a upgraded version of the former Syndicate Armor. Given the Syndicate having been a well known in its days, many mercenaries and even collectors were interested in buying the armor. Later would lead to new variations being created and though due to its having a few issues Kamyrin was not happy about it would not see nearly as much sales as she had hoped. But with new vigor she would work towards completing the next line of the project.</li><li><b>March 2203:</b> During a trip to Horizon, the crew of the White Rose would meet new trouble when there attacked by a band of Pirates looking to raid the colony. Well the would be pirates would quickly get wiped out by local colonial forces, Kamyrin and crew would assist the populace with holding off the attack well colonial militias prepared to finish them off. For this reason the crew decided to stay for awhile being hired by a number of companies on horizon to help train there guards. Even selling there phase 1 temple armor at a discount for the numerous business companies in need of guards. This would lead a few of the former guardsmen to try and talk with Kamyrin about building a PMC that specialized at task like this, aka helping local populaces and clients defend themselves though teaching of security guards. Well Kamyrin was some what disinterested at first she would give it thought, well present on the planet she would first the very location that her parents had disappeared from, her families Mechworks. Which had been sold shortly after her coming into possession of the family due to the amount of debt the family had incurred. She would find its current owners having disappeared during the reaper wars, most likely having been a casualty of the war. The colony had taken on the rights to the location and still were unsure how to handle it, this would lead to Kamyrin being sad over the matter and lead to her later return to the Colony to rebuy the old facility.</li><li><b>September 2203:</b> This month would be the turning point, were Kamyrin and her crew would grow more well known and finally turn around there state of debt and make way towards truly becoming a company. They would complete the Phase 2 Temple series which would prove a far better product then its form brother the Phase 1. With its completion and there new found wealth, Kamyrin would finally call a meeting to discuss the crews futures. The talk would last days, a few were interested in staying how they were, a few wanted to recreate the Syndicate all together, though they were few and between. Most wanted to create a PMC, having all ready thought on the subject Kamyrin would agree, but intent on making a PMC very different from many that all ready graced the stars. She spoke of idea that seemed to captivate the crew, aim towards a autonomous defense contracts. Make security measures for our clients that would permit them to operate without there group being constantly present defending them. Such ideas of automated turrets, Mobile AA defenses, bunker systems and even Mech series. Using a quick response team that was always on the move to back up clients who were in dire straights and deal with more offensive missions. The group all agreed to this idea, all that they needed to figure was settling on a name, it would be Zangeef who would in a joking manner mention Scarecrow. The very name they had adopted during there days on omega surviving day by day, well it had mixed feelings to even Zangeef it came as a surprise as they all agreed to it. Officially this day the Scarecrows would be on there way towards becoming a proper PMC, intent on making a name for themselves among the stars.</li><li><b>October 2203:</b> Returning to Horizon the newly formed company would buy the rights to the Gyvolis Mechworks. Beginning it reconstruction towards producing a newly created project Celestial, there first attempt at a automated defense system. Making it into a factory to also support increased production of there armor, hiring local populace to work the factory they came into more luck then just that. Having heard word of the reborn Temple armor a number of Syndicate Guardsmen who had gone off to do other work flocked to the new formed group. This would permit a growth in operations for the group as they made a name for themselves. They would also work out a contract with the local populace of Horizon to act as there first Clients helping in the development of a local militia to help protect the colony encase of future attacks.</li><li><b>December 2203:</b> The Company would do its first testing of products and train new found members on handling there gear. Making use of Phase 2 armor they would produce uniquely for themselves, they would test out gear against new test type armors and Custom Loki models being prepared for Project Celestial. This operation would have mixed results some armors showing more promise and odd programming in the Loki models. This would ultimately lead to Phase 3 Production of the Temple series the following year based of the results gained during the op. Given there testing they would take up a few large scale operations dealing with pirates for clients in the Terminus systems, gaining a bigger Client base and building up more.</li><li><b>July 2204:</b> The group would once again see large production of there Project Temple with the completion of the Phase 3, a more prominent version there its forefathers it would play a prominent sales piece that month leading to some customers growing interesting in out right buying the rights to its complete use. Due to interest in its contract it would be taken off the open market to await dealings with larger client that could lead to a full blown growth of Scarecrow from a small group to a true PMC.</li><li><b>October 2204:</b> Finally having gained a foothold with a important client, Scarecrow along with there leader Kamyrin would go and meet with the Amun Sovereignty intent on making a very important deal that could lunch them onto the PMC stage. This would be done with the sale of the Phase 3 contract leading to its productions going straight to the Amun military as there main stead armor. This would also permit the Scarecrows to show off there training and ability in the hope of gaining a PMC contract also out of there deal. These deals would be between the Amun's General Crafin Kod'garal and Kamyrin, as the groups set up a testing area to show of the promise of the armor, along with the Scarecrows abilities and even there newest product Project Celestial. The General showed great favor towards the armor and its capabilities, even going so far as to show a keen interest in the custom Loki mechs which had been built for the scenario. This lead to Scarecrows first major contract, well not military oriented and instead simply supplying a colonial government with armor it still scored a number of smaller contracts with others who now saw Scarecrow as a PMC player.</li><li><b>December 2204:</b> Now with a contract that could give them steady funds Scarecrow set off on producing a second facility on Horizon to act as a training center, in the future to train militia's but for now it was aimed towards training new members and former syndicate guardsmen. A new military doctrine needed to be enforced, given the company had been lax with its own training and disciple, they quickly began to recruit more people to join there ranks and train them from the ground up to be specialized in specific combat styles. This led to the creation of the Crows and numerous sub jobs that aimed towards a individual being specialized for certain situations such as guarding POI's, private security, pirate hunting, and colonial defenses. With the Crows being the military arm of the PMC it also began to recruit engineers and developers to assist with the development of new security measures that would lead it to gain new contracts, during this time Scarecrow would become a official PMC as of prior only being a band of mercenaries and engineers. They sharpened themselves into capable of taking on necessary jobs, though never taking on jobs that felt criminal in activity. This would lead to the Scarecrows gaining a White Knight like appearance to employers, which lead to some not being interested in them and others fully supporting such a security company.</li><li><b>February 2205:</b> Having spent the last 4 months developing a new structure and training routine for its newly grown numbers, its Crows had become a more disciplined force and the company side had become stable. Finally opening up the training grounds of the new horizon facility to the public it took its first batch of trainees from local horizon militia raising them up to have a much more capable unit protecting Horizon, beyond the local Scarecrows stationed there. It had also gained more former syndicate members and still making use of Temple Phase two armor, they began to plan for the construction of a new series that could separate the PMC from the Amun military that now made common use of the Phase 3 armor. This would not be implemented for a number of months but would begin planning during this time.</li><li><b>March 2205:</b> The Scarecrows are hired by the Batarian Reformers to assist with their civil war, with the Alliance civil war brewing the Scarecrows are initially disinterested with the contract but deciding they need the extra funding they send a number of military advisers to assist in the civil war. Later that month also sending a unit of Crows to support guarding important military points that lie within Reformer hands, but aside from this see little too no combat in the civil war. Well that Civil war continues the Scarecrows look towards the Alliance civil war, not knowing which side to support they find a many civilians entering their Saga complex to train under the pretense of mercenary work, many of which support the Attican insurrectionist side. Figuring that the war had not fully gone all out they stay on the side lines to see which side to join with, but continue to train insurrectionist who come to them, stating they are simply training them in self protection though they do get a good amount of heat from the Alliance military over the training.</li><li><b>July 2205:</b> Scarecrows lunch a operation against Pirate forces controlling a former GI shipyard within the Terminus systems Sowilo System, intent on taking over the facility to begin production of their own anti-piracy forces. It becomes heated week long battle as Crows fight through corridors of entrenched pirates that used the facility to supply their own forces, though with supplies running out on the cornered Pirates they begin surrendering and later the facility is captured. Using this as the beginning several other operations are led against former and lost GI facilities that had been forgotten during the Reaper War hoping to expand their facilities in the Terminus systems and expand their own power, though not all operations are a success its seen as enough to make the Scarecrows a force within the Terminus Sowilo System having pushed out major pirate forces present.</li><li><b>October 2205:</b> With the Civil War just around the corner, with fresh resources from the Rachni from their assistance in Suen and old blueprints left by G.I. The Scarecrows are successful in the construction of a somewhat decent but rushed naval power, with this growth leads to a growth in contracts and a larger built up of resources and manpower. Much more powerful than they had been years prior they begin to send advisers to the insurrectionist encampment to help train their new growing military. Knowing this will cause issues with the Alliance, Scarecrows pull out of Horizon and sell of their facilities moving to new facilities in Sowilo system distancing themselves from Alliance retaliation for their support of the rebels. With their support the Scarecrows are able to grow further as Terminus interest that seek to see a free Attican space and create a border between Citadel and Terminus space flock to the Scarecrow ranks.</li><li><b>December 2205:</b> Having announced their official support of the Insurrection and plans to deploy troops alongside the Attican forces. The Scarecrows begin their deployment throwing their full support behind the Attican state they stop assisting the Reformist of the Batarians, fearing that they might support the Alliance. Scarecrow also begins using its naval assets for privateering operations keen on increasing the Atticans states naval power without completely losing theirs in the start of the war, having worked hard to develop what they had.Working with Syndic the crows are ordered to recapture a old colony known as Mir that had fallen during the Reaper conflict years earlier. Well the battle took resources away from the civil war the crows still took part and handled clean up operations on the planet to further establish good relations with Syndic.</li><li><b>January 2206:</b> With the war continuing to spiral into a bigger and bigger conflict, Kam knew the Crows would be crushed in direct confrontation. Having kept to their privateering operations through would not garner much respect or interest from the Atticans. Her only hope was to expand her numbers so when the Crows were finally forced to make a stand alongside their allies they would do such ready. To those ends she search for ways to increase the Crows strength. Later that month she would meet Sanno, a former Dust Marked Colonel and a leader of one of the Remnants of the Skulls known as the Lost and Damned. Unlike the other factions they had no interest in becoming another Skulls and instead sought to keep the Terminus free from another org with similar interests of terror. This aligned with the Crows interest in establishing more order in the Terminus region and together they struck a deal.</li><li><b>March 2206:</b> Well the merge in the prior months had increased the Crows power base and made a way for former skulls to join their ranks. It flooded the Crows with fresh blood, requiring for a expansion that needed more money. But it was a problem that Kam though she could handle later, the last few months the Crows had made little appearance aside from assisting in the training of the Atticans. With Operation Skeleton Key the Crows made their first direct engagement with the System Alliance to further test new equipment under production such as the Odin and Albus Fighters. The Crow would see the Operation succeed and would return to their isolationist build up for the planned conflict over Akuze.</li><li><b>May 2206:</b> With the Crows thanks to their leader and conditions in the Terminus gain control over Syndic, a former allied company that had also been a remnant of the Syndicates fall. Having been aimed at colonization efforts in the Terminus they worked closley and for this reason when the former CEO stepped down Kam took control and merged the two groups together. Gaining a HQ and strong footing on their most recent colony of Mir which had been rebuilt in the last few months.Along with this Kam gained a great deal of financial gains from the take over and even got gained from colonies that had been clients of Syndic. The Crows took over protection of the colonies in Syndics place and helped establish colonial governments to handle the planets over all administration in Syndics place. Becoming strong supporters of the Crows and good clients as the Crows continued to grow.</li><li><b>June 2206:</b> Using their gains over the years, from their dealings with the Quarians, Atticans, Selachi Industries, Amun and many other clients throughout the Terminus the Crows rapidly grew. To further establish their naval presence they did research into how to produce them as quick as possible for Akuze. But it was found straight out producing them would take far too much time and instead they put effort into investigating were old confederacy ships built for the fallen Terminus power had fell. This search lead them to BDH&amp;S which had acquired a great deal of G.I's old assets. Being a System Alliance supporter the Crows knew it would be hard to get the assets and instead thought of several plans to acquire the vessels and gear. The method they choose was to work a deal with Amun to act as a middle man and buy the former Confederacy ships unarmed and rearm them once they were in Crow hands. But they also saw a chance to extend this to the Atticans and approach their government about getting a large sum of credits to also buy several ships for the Atticans. Given the Crows ability to acquire ships for the Atticans and the trust they had garnered doing such the Atticans permitted it and gave them 5 Trillion to acquire some vessels for the Atticans. Than using Amun they handled the actual deal and gained very large number of former confederacy warships that were unarmed and seeing this as a massive chance they choose to work as hard as possible so the fleet was ready for the coming conflict. Intent to keep this as a surprise to the System Alliance the Crows kept some of these facts from the Atticans and well it made them feel like the Crows had turtles to protect themselves the truth of the matter was much different.</li><li><b>October 2206:</b> Slaving away to ensure they were prepared the crows went from being a few million to being tens of millions of troops and personnel all in preparation for a single counter attack. Their fleet had gone from a few dozen to a few hundred war vessels. But the effort to rearm and build up and train the massive influx heavily was taxing the Crows. Not only did they need to further establish their training sites in Sowilo System and on Mir, they also needed to kick their shipyards into full gear and get help on the side from Selachi industries just to ensure the ships would be prepared by the end of the year. But neverless Kam felt certain when the Crows finally made their move both sides would be caught off guard by what they brought to conflict, a fact she very much enjoyed and well the Crows still had troops stationed in Akuze training Attican troops when compared to what they had building up it was but a small fraction of their troop strength.</li><li><b>December 2206:</b> with the fleet nearly prepared and word spreading of Akuze soon being targeted the Crows knew they were on the last stretch and continued their build up but given their condition they knew it would not be finished before Akuze got invaded and only hoped that Akuze could hold out for what would come. Out of all the ships they had acquired only a fraction was back up to its state of the art condition and prepared for war. The troops were continuing their training and more were still coming, with the Terminus becoming more keen on seeing a Attican victory if only to ensure their own protection. The next year would show the Crows efforts in full blossom and they would see how far all their effort would get them in the coming months.</li></ul></span></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">OOC Notes</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><ul><li> Current Img is a hold img that is mine until the commission of the actual logo is finished.</li><li>Due to the company's involvement in the SACW, some historical information might be added later based on what happens in the war.</li><li> Changelog:<ul><li> #/#/####: #</li></ul></li></ul></div>  </div>

Using advance technology and squad based tactics to take down large opposing forces the Crows are specialized in Digging in a defending clients property and the client themselves. Mirrored by the fact they use heavy armor, they favor body guard and security over wet work operations or assaults. The majority of the Scarecrows offensive and defensive strength come from the Crows which are a majority of the personnel within the PMC, many of the members leading into the Civil war are Syndicate Veterans, Former Bacalou Skulls and military Veterans of the Reaper War, ensuring the Crows always had well trained personnel on hand. Thanks to having so many members from divserse military backgrounds ensures the Scarecrows military training program is top class using training from System Alliance, Syndicate, Confederacy and Bacalou Skulls to make their troops a dangerous but military force in the Terminus. <br><br>Above the Crow's lies their elite brothers and sisters that also perform duties of officers within the Crow's command structure. Created through a mesh of training from DOST, Geist, Dust Marked and N7 Operatives the Ravens as their known as a extremely well trained and dangerous elite force. Rivaling many other nations special forces they are considered some of the best body guards a clients could acquire from dealing with the Scarecrow's. Given top of the line gear that is even better than the Crows bellow them only ensures they are a deadly fighting forces, along with training as officers every single one of them is capable of assuming control over a Crow unit and ensuring its used to its best abilities.<br><br>Well the Scarecrows norm is defense, they have developed offensive means to ensure they can expand their business, developing the Corpus unit to act as their sword and wet work operatives. Many of which were trained by Tyche, Nich or other former Assassins, some of the Corpus themselves were even former wet work operatives or Assassins. Trained to work in small teams of 4 men, they can be tactically inserted in hostile locations and cripple enemy structures or targets, well not as elite as the Ravens they are seen as a more dangerous element then their Crow brethren.<br><br>Will'o'Wisps are the least known group of the Scarecrows, rivaling the Corpus unit in size even possibly larger, the Wisps started out as the Scarecrows Omega branch. Given a new name they were meant to watch over Scarecrow interests on Omega without alerting the Big three to the Crows presence. Having grown considerably they have become the Crows intelligence service with many of their members rivaling Corpus, and Crow agents in combat ability but much more secretive about their activities than their crow brothers. They also feature a large number of Raven skilled personnel making them a well tuned intelligence agency capable of black op missions without requiring additional support from Ravens or Corpus. Though often enough the Wisps are placed in command of all Special forces operations, assembling the correct Wisp, Raven and Corpus mix to get the job done when it is necessary.</span><br><br><img src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Scarecrow Securities_files/CDb30gul.jpg" border="0" alt="user posted image"><br><span style="font-size:8pt;line-height:100%"><i>From Left to Right, Officer Crow Standard Uniform, Crow Standard Uniform, Support Personnel Standard Uniform</i></span><br><br><span style="font-size:9pt;line-height:100%"><b>Officer Crow</b> Wearing this uniform marks the individual as a officer within the Crow's unit, leading normally a squad of standard crows. The uniform is what many Crow officers wear outside of combat, capable of being used as light armor it can take a few number of blows before completely being useless. Being adopted by the Scarecrows in 2205 as a upgrade edition of Temple series armor meant for Scarecrows expressed use it has since been updated to the Odin Series armor. This has lead to a increase amount of protection, though its seen as unfit for active use in combat zones. When outside of battle it is seen as the required uniform of the day this is to separate crows on guard duty from off duty crows, and in the off chance of them coming under attack the Crow can participate in battle or at least survive tell they acquire their proper armor.<br><br><b>Crows</b> Wearing their standard unfirom is seen as the norm within a Scarecrow base or facility, well it is seen as light armor it was made to be as comfortable as possible. This led to a decrease in its defense but was seen as a worth while sacrifice to ensure the crows wore it when outside of their direct combat duties. The mask of the armor also acts as a limited time rebreather permitting the crows to operate in toxic situations or limited time in space in the off chance their location is attacked by chemical weapons or they are thrown into the dark of space. Its also the common armor used in martial training due to the fact its much more flexible then most other armor's fielded by the Scarecrows. Also Crows are not required to wear their Masks when off duty but are required to have them on their body in some way in the off chance they come under attack, though if the location is seen as hazardous or dangerous they can sometimes be required to wear it at all times.<br><br><b>Support Personnel</b> seen as the non combatants of the PMC, they can be anything from admin to technicians working on vehicles, required to wear their standard uniform when in a dangerous location or well aboard vessels. This is to ensure that even a non combatant can survive a fightfire in the off chance a Scarecrow facility is attacked, featuring less armor then the Crows standard uniform. Due to the fact the Scarecrows field such a large amount of vessels, vehicles and mechs they are fielding a far larger support staff then most other PMC's of their size. This is also partially due to the fact they aim more towards developing and defending their clients then being simple muscle heads like other contractors that operate out of the Terminus.</span><br><br><img src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Scarecrow Securities_files/cpbiub2l.jpg" border="0" alt="user posted image"><br><span style="font-size:8pt;line-height:100%"><i>From Left to Right, Crow Police, Crow Demolitions, Crow Bodyguard</i></span><br><br><span style="font-size:9pt;line-height:100%"><b>Crow Police</b> are the simplest job within the Crows ranks, hired by their clients to act as police forces for their new colonies and sometimes small cities. They are trained in non lethal combat and make use of a armor that is considered light, well more armored then the Crows standard uniform, its made more to handle nonlethal attacks such as gas, stun and brunt trauma. Many of the Crows that are placed as Police are trained to handle civilians and are much better <i>person people</i> which can handle anything from arresting to riot like situations. Most are also equipped with non lethal means of attacks such as tear gas and stun guns instead of actual fire arms in less their in a lethal location which could be attack by pirates or criminals in which case they will be armed with lethal means of force.<br><br><b>Crow Demolitions</b> Unlike other PMC groups demolitions experts the Scarecrows are trained more towards disarming planted explosives then planting them. Though given their extensive training to disarm such things they also can make great use of the explosives if need. Many are hired along with Crow Police by clients normally only two man teams to ensure that on the off chance a bomb is placed on client property the Police forces can handle such dangers, though they can also find themselves alongside more conventional military forces to handle explosive though then they might be equipped with more standard armor. Unlike the police armor they make use of more padding and protection from explosives then from direct attack, this lead to them being easier targets if directly attacked, though it would be suspected a location they would be at would all ready be secured by Crow Police.<br><br><b>Crow Bodyguards</b> Much better trained then their police brethren they are capable of working in 4 man teams and are meant to protect a specific target instead of buildings or cities like their police brothers. Using less non lethal means they will ensure their client is protect and eliminate any possible dangers. To this end they are equipped with more armor then the police but not enough to classify it as a medium armor, Given the specialty of their occupation many crow personnel who act as bodyguards don't double as military personnel compared to their policing brothers. This leaves the Scarecrows with a small but specific list meant for only body guarding contracts, when not on a client job they are left protecting key Scarecrow personnel.</span><br><br><img src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Scarecrow Securities_files/OqTfwx4l.jpg" border="0" alt="user posted image"><br><span style="font-size:8pt;line-height:100%"><i>From Left to Right, Crow Male, Crow Female, Crow Marine</i></span><br><br><span style="font-size:9pt;line-height:100%"><b>Crows</b> make up the majority of the Scarecrows combat personnel and when on duty often sport the most common armor within the crows ranks, Odin Series Medium armor. Created specifically for Scarecrows its a costly armor made to protect its user in most environments and is installed with Pattern camo, which was common to many of the Temple armors more special operations types. This permits the user to switch is color scheme and camo to match his surroundings, making the Scarecrows the only PMC not to have a standard color scheme, primary because their armor distinguishes who the operator is. A single crow is seen as well trained and many were Veterans of the Attican civil war fighting for the insurrectionist and later joining the Scarecrows after the war ended, making each personnel lethal and well trained.<br><br><b>Female Crows</b> well not a uncommon sight within the ranks of the Scarecrows many serve non combat roles, though this does not deter many strong willed females from joining the Crows. For this reason Kamyrin had a special edition of the Odin medium armor made, to fit perfectly to female bodies, this is seen as different then many armors which instead are made for both genders. Many female crows are scouts within the crow ranks due to their armor being slightly thinner and lighter, this of course has led to the armor being somewhat weaker in terms of defense its still seen as a effective medium armor.<br><br><b>Crow Marines</b> Due to the fact the Scarecrows produced their own naval fleet, it required specific guards and units to be aboard it as protectors. These Crows are outfitted with a special armor capable of working in space much better then their land based brothers, leading to the Crow Marines. Though much smaller in numbers compared to the land base crows which make up the majority of the PMC's military power, they are still seen as dangerous foes trained to storm pirate vessels and capture to ships though corridor to corridor battles. Also capable of defending their own ships from boarding actions, they are also often found aboard Scarecrow space stations, specifically the Scarecrow shipyards which had formerly been owned by GI.</span><br><br><img src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Scarecrow Securities_files/SAJevXkl.jpg" border="0" alt="user posted image"><br><span style="font-size:8pt;line-height:100%"><i>From Left to Right, Crow Destroyer, Crow Heavy, Crow Extermination specialist</i></span><br><br><span style="font-size:9pt;line-height:100%"><b>Crow Destroyer</b> are troops trained specially for the Odin Destroyer armor which is a power armored version of the smaller version of the Odin series. Due to the armor's powered nature it is a tank of the battle field capable of having weapon systems installed onto it but in so it requires special training that can be long and due to its large cost its limited to only a small number of crows. For this reason when a Destroyer is deployed its seen as a pivot point of combat capable of unleashing a large amount of power upon its enemies well taking a large amount of damage in turn. Only those that are believed capable of handling such a system can be trained in it and not everyone passes the training, also due to its large size and requiring a team to deal with its maintenance its not often deployed to support defense operations instead being used primarily in defense operations.<br><br><b>Crow Heavies</b> are hard targets to deal with making use of the Odin heavy armor its seen as the heavy weapon specialist normally carrying a machine gun or another heavy weapon. Almost every Crow team makes use of at least one Heavy encase the team needs to entrench a position the Heavy is capable of laying down a large amount of fire, but due to its slowness it requires the support of the other crows to cover gaps in its offensive abilities. Also featuring the second heavies armor of the Odin series it is seen as a hard foe to take down, but for this same reason its a more costly edition of the series.<br><br><b>Crow Extermination specialist</b> are trained to use the Extermination armor, another rare version of the Odin series it was made to specifically deal with large swarming enemies. Due the Scarecrows having fought reaper forces before in support of the Rachni it was seen as a needed unit in the off chance the Scarecrows ever fought a foe that tried swarming them ever again. To this end its a specially designed heavy armor that is equipped with a flame throw and capable of burning away entire fields of enemies, though it is also a explosive target when enemy snipers are present. The armor is made to handle intense heat and is well armored to protect the user from exploding, when under heavy fire though when attacked to much it still has a chance of igniting the fuel cells and making the user into a bomb. For this reason its not common for many Crows to pick up this occupation though within every group their is those crazy few, normally used on contracts were burning away dangerous wildlife is required, and kept on call in the of chance of finding reaper forces that were abandoned after the war.</span><br><br><img src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Scarecrow Securities_files/SlVG8ZHl.jpg" border="0" alt="user posted image"><br><span style="font-size:8pt;line-height:100%"><i>From Left to Right, Corpus Sniper, Corpus, Corpus Hunter</i></span><br><br><span style="font-size:9pt;line-height:100%"><b>Corpus Sniper</b> is the lethal long ranged killer of the Scarecrows, like its Corpus brothers these units excel at nothing else then attacking their foe. Trained by Assassins and Marksmans they are some of the best shooters the Scarecrows have and capable of eliminating targets from long distances with their silenced weapons. Using the Loki version of the Odin, there armor lacks active camo and instead has gillie like material, making use of Pattern camo they are trained to not move for days, to this end their trained to not rely on normal stealth tech. Since such technology would take up too much energy to run over such long amounts of time and to this end it was taken out of the armor to ensure its user would not trust it.<br><br><b>Corpus</b> operators all make use of one version or another of the Loki armor, though like their Raven brothers they are permitted to use what ever gear or armor they find necessary to complete their mission. Though many lack the funds to buy extremely expensive armor's and therefore making primary use of the Loki armor, trained to be as lethal as possible they are very well trained in hand to hand and close quarters fighting styles. Capable of eliminating their targets even without a fire arm, they unlike their sniper brothers have a optical camo equipped, expecting to handle quicker missions then them. Working in teams of 4 they also work with at least one Corpus hunter which is a tracker expert, when not being hired by clients to take out specific targets they are testing out new Scarecrow defense technology seeing how well it handles assassins.<br><br><b>Corpus Hunter</b> is a tracking specialist with every Corpus team their is at least 1 Hunter and working alongside every Corpus sniper is one Hunter acting as a spotter for their brother. Making use of the M-6 Custom Stealth drone they are capable scouts and their Loki armor has special visions to permit the hunter to find their target, then direct their brothers in eliminating that target. Much like their Sniper brothers they lack the optical camo and instead only feature the Pattern camo though this is for a different reason primary because their armor is a energy eater due to all the sensory tech equipped to it.</span><br><br><img src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Scarecrow Securities_files/weprJWhl.jpg" border="0" alt="user posted image"><br><span style="font-size:8pt;line-height:100%"><i>From Left to Right, Crying Ravens, Raven Standard Uniform, Raven</i></span><br><br><span style="font-size:9pt;line-height:100%"><b>Crying Raven's</b> are considered the Elite of the elite many of whom were trained by Sarah Redfield and act as Kam's personal guard. They take their role seriously and are always found beside Kam, though small in number then any other unit within the Scarecrows, this is primary due to the fact they are a completely female unit and many believe Sarah's choice in recruits a prime reason. Trained in the practice of bodyguards they take it to a completely different level, many could argue theirs few in the galaxy better at protecting a single person then the Crying Ravens and for a certain reason they can be sometimes hired to protect clients. Though many times this is specifically well known clients that work side by side with the Scarecrows or are personal friends with Kam, for this reason they are one of the least seen but well known members of the Scarecrows.<br><br><b>Raven's Standard Uniforms</b> are very similar to the standard uniform of the crows aside from the fact that their made better and are more expensive then the common uniform. Capable of being used as a normal light armor, they also distinguish Raven's from crows given that the Ravens are commonly used as elites and commanders of crows. Their uniform also is equipped with Pattern Camo permitting them to use it as their stealth armor when doing operations that require a lighter armor then their standard Priest armor. They much like the Corpus are capable of using what ever gear they wish including personally owned weapons and armor as long as they believe it is better for them to use. To these ends some Raven's make use gear they had prior to joining the Scarecrows but this is rare due to the fact the Raven Priest armor is seen as one of the Best Odin armors, though unlike crows Ravens are also permitted to wear regular clothing when on duty, due to their raised status.<br><br><b>Ravens</b> are the Elite of the Scarecrows military forces, being capable commanders they take control of major operations that the Scarecrows units participate in. They also sometimes are sent on crucial or well paid missions to handle specific jobs for clients or even act as elite body guards only being second to the Crying Ravens, Kam's personal guard. Raven's are only taken from Crows that show exceptional abilities and then trained in a manner similar to the Geists of the Syndicate which were once Elites that rivaled Dust Marked. Well the Raven's are not capable of taking on Dust marked, Specters or other groups elites they are still considered some of the best troops the Scarecrows have and in groups should be considered very dangerous and lethal foes.<br></span><br></center></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Military Numbers</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="text-align: left; display: none;"><span style="font-family:Century Gothic"><br><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:100%">Combat Personnel</span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:100%"><ul><li>12,567,150 Crow Regulars(4,267,809 Reserves still under Training)</li><li>3,309,721 Corpus Operatives(2,059,453 Reserves still under Training)</li><li>3,250,542 Raven Officers(1,340,535 Reserves still under Training)</li><li>1,679,460 Will'o'Wisp Operatives(553,705 Reserves still under Training)</li><li>378,678 Naval Crew &amp; Crow Marines(45,056 Reserves still under Training)</li><li>4,095 Crying Raven Officers(775 Reserves still under Training)</li></ul></span><br><br><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:100%">Non-combat Personnel</span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:100%"><ul><li>893,062 Administration &amp; Supply Personnel</li><li>678,745 Labor Personnel</li><li>34,051 Technical &amp; Research Personnel</li><li>14,573 Public Affairs Personnel</li><li>11,607 Medical Care Employees</li><li>8,948 Cyber Security &amp; Programmers</li></ul><b>Total Combat Personnel:</b> 21,189,646 Active (8,267,333 Under Training currently)<br><b>Total Non-Combat Personnel:</b> 1,640,986<br><b>Total Employees:</b> 31,101,465</span></span><br></div><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Crow Equipment</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family:Century Gothic"><br><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:100%">Weapons</span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:100%"><ul><li>Dunaxxi-205 Rifle</li><li>FL-3 "Colossus" Assault Rifle</li><li>Legacy Military Grade Weapons</li></ul></span><br><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:100%">Armors</span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:100%"><ul><li>Temple Second Generation Armor(2205-2206)</li><li>Odin Series Armor(2206-Current)</li><li>Deamon Series Stealth Armor</li></ul></span><br><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:100%">Misc Equipment</span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:100%"><ul><li>Celestial Series Mechs</li></ul></span><br><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:100%">Vehicles</span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:100%"><ul><li>Dragoon Hover Bike</li><li>Grail-24/26 MBT</li><li>Albus Support Fighter</li><li>Enca Interceptors</li><li>Bennetti Tactical Dropship/Gunship</li><li>Insularis Tactical Bomber</li></ul></span></span></div><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Crow Ranks</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family:Century Gothic"><br><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:100%">Crow Enlisted Ranks</span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:100%"><ul><li><b>Intiate</b> -Initial entry Rank for all new recruits into the Crow Ranks prior to Officially going through Boot camp</li><li><b>Hatchling</b> -Rank for all members currently going through basic training and advanced course training.</li><li><b>Fledgling Crow</b> -First Official rank for all Crow members that have gone through basic training and advanced occupation training.

Requiring a massive build up over a short amount of time the Crows decided against rebuilding the vessels from the ground up and instead choose to buy the ships from BDH&amp;S though Amun. Given after G.I's collapse many of their products and ships fell into BDH&amp;S control which due to the situation and no citadel aimed military interested in buying the ships of a force that wanted to directly oppose them. The ships were simply declawed and sold on a small basis to people that wanted ships. But this left a great deal sitting around so when Amun approached them as a middle man for the Crows in buying many of the vessels for both the Crows and the Attican states a fact that BDH&amp;S never knew about they permitted it. With this the Crows gained the vessels they needed but had to instead of building vessels refit the entire fleet to meet their needs in the war. <br><br>With the fact the vessels had been meant to be the core of the Confederacies fleet prior to its collapse as a conventional fleet against the Citadel forces the ships are still top of the line warships. But even with this in mind the vessels were not a perfect match given the quick development and never truly being field tested. But with Kam and Selachi who assisted them in the refitting the ships were prepared specifically to challenge the System Alliance ships. Kam even went as far to use the Quarian ships she had gained from the federation to assist with the refits, given Quarian ships being hardy vessels meant to last it has made the Crow vessel ships that might not rival System Alliance vessels in mobility, but instead vessels capable of surviving more hits than ships of the same class. This has made the Crow's preferred doctrine of warfare is to keep enemies at a distance in which they can simply shrug off enemy rounds and slowly wear down the enemies though a battle of attrition. With this the Crows favor high class ships over mass quantity ships which are normally the preferred by many other powers in the Terminus. But has left the Crows as a slightly smaller naval force when compared to their competitors, but in the way of firepower they either rival or easily out match many other Terminus powers.<br><br>Even with many of the ships being former confederacy, not all are, some being captured vessels of the system alliance or even vessels built from the ground up to serve the Crows needs through the assistance of Selachi's company who has taken over many of the productions given Crows being more a military force than a ship building company. The Crow's Albus Tactical Fighter, Bennetti Tactical Dropship, and a few others being built from the ground up to serve their needs and better fit their doctrine of heavy defense.<br><br><b>Structure:</b><br>Given the Crow's being a Paramilitary corporation they often deploy their fleets based of the needs of the clients more than having a specific structure of command. Meaning a fleet could be anything from a small patrol fleet to guard a corporate trade lane to being a massive war fleet to assist in massive battles in the terminus which could amount to most of their naval strength. This means a Admiral of the Crows could be leading a fleet of only 7 cruisers and 5 frigates to commanding most of the Crows naval assets in a single fleet.The only two fleets that are fully structured and always present is the Grail Defense Fleet and the Mir Defense fleet which are always watching the Crows to chief locations of interest from possible pirate attack or aggression from competitors. <br><br><b>Naming Convention:</b><br>Ship Classes-<i>Latin Name for Crows</i><br>Prefix for All Crow Vessels is <i>SNV</i> - <b>S</b>rarecrow Secuirties <b>N</b>aval <b>V</b>essals<br><br>Dreadnoughts/Battleships- Knights of the Round Table<br>Carriers-  Mythological Knights &amp; Warriors<br>Cruisers/Frigates/Corvettes- Historical Knights &amp; Warriors<br></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Commissioned Vessels</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="text-align: left;"><br><b>Dreadnaughts:</b><ul><li><i>Cornix-Class</i><br>- SNV Arthur <br></li><li><i>Imparatus-Class</i><br>- SNV Lancelot <br>- SNV Gawain<br>- SNV Kay<br>- SNV Tristan<br> <br><b>Battleships:</b><br></li><li><i>Edithae-Class</i><br>- SNV Aban<br>- SNV Agravain<br>- SNV Gingalain<br>- SNV Ector<br>- SNV Safir<br>.....10 More Active Service, 2 Under Construction <br><br><b>Escort Carriers:</b><br></li><li><i>Kubaryi-Class</i><br>- SNV Warwick <br>- SNV Ivanhoe<br>- SNV Kahedin<br>- SNV Cawline<br>- SNV Ganelon<br>.....10 More Active Service, 3 Under Construction<br><br><b>Cruisers:</b><br></li><li><i>Validus-Class</i><br>- SNV Joan <br>- SNV Wallace<br>- SNV Czarny<br>- SNV Drake<br>- SNV Cortés<br>.....35 More Active Service, 19 Under Construction<br></li><li><i><a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/mass_effect_codex/stockholm-class-t12019.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Stockholm-class</a></i><br>- SNV Bismarck<br></li><li><i><a href="https://masseffectuniverse.jcink.net/index.php?showtopic=436" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Isurus-class</a>[i]<br>- SNV Camberg<br>- SNV Winkelried<br>- SNV Payens<br>.....6 More Active Service in limited Run<br><br><b>Light Carrier:</b><br> </i></li><li><i>[i]Florensis-Class</i><br>- SNV Kahedin<br>- SNV Naimon<br>- SNV Ortnit<br>- SNV Pinabel<br>- SNV Roland<br>.....5 More Active Service, 7 Under Construction<br><br><br><b>Light Cruisers:</b><br></li><li><i>Nasicus-Class</i><br>.....60 Active Service, 36 Under Construction<br><br><b>Frigates:</b><br></li><li><i>Violaceus-Class</i><br>.....70 Active Service, 47 Under Construction<br><br><b>Corvettes:</b><br></li><li><i>Typicus-Class</i><br>.....80 Active Service, 62 Under Construction<br><br><b>Support Vessels:</b><br></li><li><i>Orru-Class</i><br>.....26 Active Service, 32 Under Construction<br></li><li><i>Rose-Class</i><br>.....1 Active Service</li></ul></div>  </div>

After starting many of their business deals they bought the Gyvolis Mechworks on Horizon and later the Saga Complex to be their new HQ and training facilities, but due to their support for the insurrection they sold their facilities and retreated into the Terminus. Having captured former GI shipyard present in the Sowilo system and a number of other former GI facilities, turning them into key Scarecrow facilities to support the ever growing PMC company. Now the Scarecrows have become the Established power of the Sowilo system, having repaired its refueling station and a number of key facilities across the planets and driving off Pirate forces. Along with the capturing of the system the Scarecrows. After their merge with Syndic the Crows have set up a headquarters on Mir along with building a strong present around the colony. With their recent growths they have expanded to several facilities throughout the Terminus that permit the company to a Terminus power.<br><br><b>Major Facilities:</b><ul><li><s>Gyvolis Mechworks: Horizon: Former Scarecrows HQ</s>[Abandoned Because of the Attican Civil War]</li><li><s>Saga Complex: Horizon: Training facility</s>[Abandoned Because of the Attican Civil War]</li><li>New Saga Complex: Mir: Current Scarecrow HQ's</li><li>Scythe District: Omega: Scarecrow base presence on Omega</li><li>Reapers Den: Omega: Scarecrow HQ on Omega</li><li>Kryin Heavy Industries: Amun: Factory that handles most the Crows production of equipment.</li><li>Grail Orbital Shipyards: Thurisaz Orbit: Scarecrow Shipyards and 3 former GI facility</li><li>Sage Refueling and Repair Station: Thurisaz Orbit: Scarecrow Automatic Fueling Station and Former GI Refueling station</li><li>Excalibur Tower: Hagalaz: Scarecrow Training HQ</li><li>Trilogy Complex: Hagalaz: Scarecrow Training Facility</li><li>Mask Complex: Ansuz: Scarecrow R&amp;D Facility</li><li>Crown Tower: Illium: Scarecrow Office and Recruitment center</li></ul><br><b>Lesser Facilities:</b><ul><li>(12) Factories: Amun: Attached to KHI it handles more priority needs of the Crows production</li><li>(30) Storage Facilites: Terminus Systems: Houses much of Scarecrows supplies outside of their major facilities</li><li>(20) Offices: Terminus Systems: Houses a small staff for Administration and Recruitment</li><li>(40) Safe Houses: Terminus Systems: Spread through out the Terminus these facilities house small detachments of Crows and act as safe locations for resupplying.</li><li>(10) Training Facilities: Terminus Systems: Built through out the Terminus in many different Ecosystems as possible to allow new trainees to get a good taste of different environments and to handle overflow of recruitment. </li><li>(12) Bases: Terminus Systems: Well not nearly as fortified as the Sowilo system or Mir these bases at as garrison sites for Crows through out the Terminus and are often situated on colonies that are under contract with the Crows.They permit fast response teams for the Crows so they can reach through out the Terminus if needed.</li><li>(4) Resupply Stations: Terminus Systems: Orbital stations with a small garrison and supplies for ships so they can continue their routes without having to return to Mir or Sowilo every time they need a resupply.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td><center><span style="font-size:13pt;line-height:100%"><span style="font-family:Century Gothic"><span style="color:Orange">Relations</span></span></span></center><br><center><img src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Scarecrow Securities_files/azqzjh9l.jpg" border="0" alt="user posted image"></center><br><br><b>Description:</b><br>Being a group that formed from many other groups after their collapse including but not limited too Syndicate, Syndic, Bacalou Skulls, and the Terminus Confederacy it has lead to the group having poors or outright hostel relations with organisations mostly due to its members. Well it has gained a great deal of fresh blood the mix of these peoples ideal's has lead to a slight warp in the Crows ideals. Originally meant to be a company that simply wanted to produce automated defense systems for clients and train people to defend themselves instead of being outright paramilitary army. They have become that very thing mostly due to the members they took in and their ongoing presence in the Attican conflicts having to produce a army capable of fighting with the System Alliance. Now becoming more of a Terminus power with strained relations with the Citadel, unlike many other PMC's the Crows take pride in their own ideology. One were they seek to create and preserve order in the Terminus but keep it free of Citadel power. Never will they take a job that would harm innocent people which they often consider many of the colonist and actually prefer or sometimes even go out of their way to defend. But that does not mean they will not do under handed or outright illegal methods to accomplish their goals. The most simplest difference between them and other's like the Blue Suns, Blood Pact and Eclipse is their in it less for the money and more for the ideals that the Crows are formed around. These leaves them more likely to take jobs for less if they align with their ideals and often leads them into direct engagements with most Pirates and other PMC's, a fact they slightly enjoy due to their origins. Many Corporations trust them due to the fact they never go back on their contract and never switch sides due to money, though some more shady companies have a problem with this.For this reason well not seen in good light by the Citadel they are the Knights of the Terminus by many simple colonist that simply want to create a life beyond the Citadel for one reason or another. <br><br><center><b>Relations:</b></center><ul><li><span style="color:green"><i>Allied Relations</i></span><br>- <b>Attican Insurrection:</b> Choosing to side with the Rebellion early into the war seeing the merit of creating a wall against the System Alliance for the Terminus. They first started the war simply training new Attican recruits and handling privateering operations to further establush the AI. Later into the war they took more direct approaches and actually deployed their troops and navy to assist the AI forces.<br><br>- <b>Amun Sovereignty:</b> With the sale of Temple series armor to Amun's military being one of the main reasons for the Crows foundation and growth has kept the two groups in a close relationship. Also with even acting as middle men in the purchase of the former Confederacy ships they continued support has permitted the crows to prosper. <br><br>- <b>Blades of Lao:</b> Well the Crows are unsure how much they can trust the Skull's remnants and given many members joined their ranks they have a uneasy alliance and training deal with the Blades.<br><br>- <b>Death's Eye:</b> Given the Crows dealings with Death's eyes they feel a better established Alliance with the Dust Marked Remnants than the Blades who are more Chaotic in nature. The Crow's often hire them when they need the extra muscle to assist with a major deal or operations that requires a force built to fight the SA's N7s.<br><br>- <b>Selachi Industries:</b> Having a very close connection to the company that helps build most of the Crow's ships in return for security services. The two companies have had a very good mutual dealings over the last years that the Crow's seek to further strengthen.<br><br>- <b>Love Relay:</b> Having a good business deal with the new company and owning 20% of it has left the Crow's in a favorable position with the company that they seek to further expand. <br><br></li><li><span style="color:lightblue"><i>Friendly Relations</i></span><br>- <b>Rachni Harmonic:</b> Having worked with the Rachni when they looked for help reclaiming their home world, the Crow's have had favorable dealings with them and seek to further establish a dealing with the Rachni.<br><br>- <b>Quarian Federation:</b> Well not known the Crows have had dealings with the QF during the civil war but it was left off the books to not cause issues with the Federation. In turn they got a good sum of money and several hulls they use to help reinforce their own fleet. <br><br>- <b>Salarian Union:</b> Unlike other Citadel forces the Crow's have no standing issues with the SU and instead had a good one time deal with them that has kept both groups on good terms over the years.<br><br>- <b>Aggerholm Industries:</b> Having several deals with the company that were later cancelled due to the Scarecrows presence in the Civil War has still kept the two companies on good terms.<br><br></li><li><span style="color:white"><i>Nuetral Relations</i></span><br>- <b>Geth Collective:</b> Given the little interaction that has yet to even occured the Crows have no interest in the Geth.<br><br>- <b>Batarian Hegemony:</b> Well the Crows did assist the reformist for less than a year they later walked away due to their presence in the Attican Civil war and beyond that has yet to have any other interactions.<br><br>- <b>Asari Republics:</b> Well the Crows have outright fought the System Alliance and on a small end the Turians the Crows have yet to interact with the Asari and therefore has paid little attention to them.<br><br>- <b>Shadow Broker Network:</b> Pays no mind to the network in less they need info.<br><br>- <b>Cerberus:</b> Given lack of interaction Crows have no real interest in the group.<br><br>- <b>Bacalou Skulls Remnants:</b> Beyond the ones listed above the Crows have yet to actual establish any contact with the other factions.<br><br>- <b>The Krogan Empire:</b> Due to little interaction has led to the Crows paying little mind to the Empires actions.<br><br></li><li><span style="color:orange"><i>Strained Relations</i></span><br>- <b>Blue Suns:</b> Due to being formed from the Syndicate has left a bad taste with the group and given being in the same line of bussiness has led to competition.<br><br>- <b>Eclipse:</b> Due to being formed from the Syndicate has left a bad taste with the group and given being in the same line of bussiness has led to competition.<br><br>- <b>Blood Pack:</b> Due to being formed from the Syndicate has left a bad taste with the group and given being in the same line of bussiness has led to competition.<br><br>- <b>Turian Hierarchy:</b> due to both factions presence in the Civil war on opposing sides has left the Crows in a unfavorable position against the Turians.<br><br></li><li><span style="color:red"><i>Hostile Relations</i></span><br>- <b>System Alliance:</b> Given the Crows theft of ships, outright open conflict and aiding the Atticans has left the two in outright conflict. Well many of its members might be veterans the issues that have arose over the civil war has left the Crows in a very bad state and relations with the System Alliance.<br><br>- <b>Grey Sektor:</b> Given their outright hatred for Terminus factions and assistances of the System Alliance it has left the Crows to have a great deal of hatred towards the paramilitary group and its leader.<br><br>- <b>Cord-Hislop Aerospace:</b> Due to Crow raids against System Alliance Targets they often damaged CHA property and ships that were under repair by the company. Which has led to CHA stating the Crow's are nothing more than terrorist and leave both groups in very bad relations. <br><br>- <b>Reaper Forces:</b> Like most the galaxy the Crows have felt the terror of the Reapers and sometimes will go out of their way to clear sites with remnant forces left.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Major Deals</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family:Century Gothic"><center><b>Major Deals:</b></center><ul><li><b>Amun Sovereignty:</b> Having been a major reason for the Crow's formation with the sale of Temple armor and continued sale of the armor continuing the fund the Scarecrows.

Neither of which are allied, This leads to tier 3 being a war zone, within days established lines appear. Well resistance is strong both forces slowly are depleted on both resources and manpower. Within in weeks niether stands capable of continuing the conflict this leads to the collapse of both factions. The Big three move in to claim what remains splitting the districts between one another. A small group of Syndicate Guardsmen lead by Zangeef Chang, a armorer for the Syndicate, move from there isolated outpost within former Syndicate territory to the Bacalou Skull's Geist district. Hoping to reform with other units in more friendly territory no longer being capable of holding out. The survivors reform only being 37 strong, with a few injured from breaking through enemy lines. Without capable medical attention the count becomes 32 members, week later reports come in that Syndicate is no more. This leads to there count becoming even less as Guardsmen toss aside there armor and leave, in the end only 24 remain under Zangeefs command.</li><li><b>February 2201:</b> Zangeef now in command of the small group makes a decision, no longer a part of there former group they re brand themselves mercenaries, taking on the nickname Scarecrows as a reminder of there guardsmen past. Placing there armor in storage crates they decide to hide there origins and look for jobs to keep there group alive. Hiding in a old storage building they take any jobs they find. During one job for a local gang to take out a competing gang they lose 3 members when there caught off guard by the enemy gang. With such a lose 2 more leave worried that this line of work is no good for them. By the end of the month the group is 19 strong, with such numbers and the money they made from the few jobs they scrapped togather they lay lower hoping to evade the attention of the Big Three still fearing one day there hideout would be found along with there past.</li><li><b>March 2201:</b> The small group too there surprise meets with a former member of the Syndicate who seemed to have lucky not been present during the war. A former Geist at that known as Sarah Redfield, with her unable to speak they assist her in finding jobs she can do on her own. Now and then she stops by the lend a helping hand but for the most part does not rejoin the small group. One day well a few members were out they were spotted by a former Syndicate Guardsmen turn Blue Suns merc. Identifying them to his commanding officers it leads to a shoot out as a Drunk Ralso and two other members try and fight off the group of Blue Suns. Killing the Former guardsmen but losing his two campanions, he flees back to the hideout. Soon followed by a group of Blue Suns looking for blood it leads to a shoot out as the group attempt to escape. Losing another member who stayed behind to lay a trap the Blue Suns. They find the building in flames hours later, with no one left alive. Moving to a new location they once again set up, Ralso gets in a great deal of trouble over the matter but in the end it is disregarded due to the fact they had all ready lost to many members. With only 16 members left the group continue to stay low and collect jobs just interested in trying to pass away the days. Zangeef takes up odd jobs fixing armor for other local Mercs and Bacalou Skulls members. Later that month word of the Reapers quickly spread, this leads to 3 members leaving intend on going home and protecting what they have left. The group would go quite for the Reaper conflict uninterested in fighting the war and only trying to scrap together a living.</li><li><b>April 2201:</b> A Former member who had left the group months earlier to fight the Reapers finds herself stuck in a medical bed. Having both her legs blown off well engaging Reaper forces her injuries are great and doctors suspect she has little time left. intent on living through it she passes her time wandering about her roommate who had been in Coma when she had been brought in, a Alliance officer from what she could figure. She yearned to make a friend in her final hours, maybe pass on the story of her life so at least one person would remember her, maybe even pass on word of her death to her former comrades.</li><li><b>May 2201:</b> the young officer that the former Guardsmen had waited for so long to see awaken finally awoke early in the month. After she had finally regained her senses both girls spoke of themselves, the guardsmen finding out that the officer was a rich born girl, who family had fallen on hard times and she had joined the military as she planned what to do in the future. The girl she learned was named Kamyrin Gyvolis, well her injuries had not been bad well the girls spoke for days, they found the Kamyrin was going to be discharged from the Alliance military. The guardsmen spoke to Kamyrin and attempted to advise her on what to do with her future, one the guardsmen would not be around to see. This would be probably were the seed of the Scarecrows would be placed, as the Guardsmen spoke of her days in the Syndicate and the fearsome armor. The Armor would become a great interest to Kamyrin even in a passion that would for a time be a sole objective of the young girl to find. But well it had been a great time and the two grew close together one night late into the month the Guardsmen passed away. This struck Kamyrin and would lead her on a search to find the armor intent on rebuilding it not only to make a good amount of cash but also as a way to remember the fallen Guardsmen.</li><li><b>November 2201:</b> The group would still be continuing there small time operations, taking on what ever job to continue on living. A few members would even make  mention of hoping to go to Illium to find if any other members of the Syndicate might have survived, Ralso being a prime person that sought this. But Zangeef would simply remind them they barly made enough money to feed the group, let alone travel to another world, no matter how bad it was Omega they had no were left to go. Thats the only reason such a band had stayed togather for the last few months. With the Reaper War over, they simply hoped to stay away from there enemies the Big Three. This would not go as they had hoped, once again there band would be attacked but this time by Eclipse. Intend on wiping out a small mercenary band, it was only a bonus they were former Syndicate members. But this time they had been prepared even having set up a second hideout encase of attack. Fleeing to the Trythorian District, this had all ready acted as a second place for them to act out of when handling missions but they hoped that the Eclipse mercs would simply become disinterested.</li><li><b>May 2202:</b> For months they had passed away the time in silence continuing with there regular odd jobs, anything to survive as they saw it. This month after so much time searching since her leaving medical care Kamyrin would find luck with her and for once in the past year the group of former Guardsmen would find luck themselves. Kamyrin would find Ralso in a drunk state talking of the good old days, much similar in fashion to the way they had got in trouble before. Wandering back to the Hideout he would be followed by the Armorer intent on meeting with him, she would be in for a surprise to find Zangeef and there group. At first hostile and scared worried they might once again have to flee, after a hour long discussion both groups would happily make a deal. Zangeef would hand over the armor they had stored from there Syndicate days in return they would get a job working for Kamyrin aboard her vessel the White Rose.</li><li><b>July 2202:</b> Only a month after the former Guardsmen turned mercenaries had joined the Crew of the White Rose did they find themselves in a new adventure. Well still working on Project Temple the first product that the group would make, they found themselves in a bind. Well on Omega the younger Gyvolis siblings had gone out shopping and found themselves surrounded by a local gang. Interested in trying to sell the girls on the slave market they were taken. Not only did this send Kamyrin into a rare rage, it also send the new White Rose group into a panic. Zangeef, Ralso and a few other Guardsman taken on the former armor of there Syndicate days, lunched a all out attack on the gang. Hunting for the girls, they finally found them after having left quite a mess in there tracks, well heading back to this ship they also found themselves in a new bind. The Blue Suns did not take a liking to Syndicate armor even making a appearance in there area and attacked the group. Well no one died the group for a few months stayed away from Omega not intending to fight the Blue Suns. After that little miss adventure the Younger Gyvolis siblings grew closer to there crew members Zangeef and Ralso, making the crew almost into one big family. They would start up working doing training with the Gyvolis siblings teaching them to defend themselves. During this trip they would also gain a new member Sarah who would become Kamyrins loyal bodyguard and even a friend.</li><li><b>December 2202:</b> This month would prove to be the biggest stride in the White Rose crew becoming a true business, though later the funds would be turned towards building them into a PMC, that would not be decided tell far later. This month would mark the creation of the Phase 1 Temple series armor, a upgraded version of the former Syndicate Armor. Given the Syndicate having been a well known in its days, many mercenaries and even collectors were interested in buying the armor. Later would lead to new variations being created and though due to its having a few issues Kamyrin was not happy about it would not see nearly as much sales as she had hoped. But with new vigor she would work towards completing the next line of the project.</li><li><b>March 2203:</b> During a trip to Horizon, the crew of the White Rose would meet new trouble when there attacked by a band of Pirates looking to raid the colony. Well the would be pirates would quickly get wiped out by local colonial forces, Kamyrin and crew would assist the populace with holding off the attack well colonial militias prepared to finish them off. For this reason the crew decided to stay for awhile being hired by a number of companies on horizon to help train there guards. Even selling there phase 1 temple armor at a discount for the numerous business companies in need of guards. This would lead a few of the former guardsmen to try and talk with Kamyrin about building a PMC that specialized at task like this, aka helping local populaces and clients defend themselves though teaching of security guards. Well Kamyrin was some what disinterested at first she would give it thought, well present on the planet she would first the very location that her parents had disappeared from, her families Mechworks. Which had been sold shortly after her coming into possession of the family due to the amount of debt the family had incurred. She would find its current owners having disappeared during the reaper wars, most likely having been a casualty of the war. The colony had taken on the rights to the location and still were unsure how to handle it, this would lead to Kamyrin being sad over the matter and lead to her later return to the Colony to rebuy the old facility.</li><li><b>September 2203:</b> This month would be the turning point, were Kamyrin and her crew would grow more well known and finally turn around there state of debt and make way towards truly becoming a company. They would complete the Phase 2 Temple series which would prove a far better product then its form brother the Phase 1. With its completion and there new found wealth, Kamyrin would finally call a meeting to discuss the crews futures. The talk would last days, a few were interested in staying how they were, a few wanted to recreate the Syndicate all together, though they were few and between. Most wanted to create a PMC, having all ready thought on the subject Kamyrin would agree, but intent on making a PMC very different from many that all ready graced the stars. She spoke of idea that seemed to captivate the crew, aim towards a autonomous defense contracts. Make security measures for our clients that would permit them to operate without there group being constantly present defending them. Such ideas of automated turrets, Mobile AA defenses, bunker systems and even Mech series. Using a quick response team that was always on the move to back up clients who were in dire straights and deal with more offensive missions. The group all agreed to this idea, all that they needed to figure was settling on a name, it would be Zangeef who would in a joking manner mention Scarecrow. The very name they had adopted during there days on omega surviving day by day, well it had mixed feelings to even Zangeef it came as a surprise as they all agreed to it. Officially this day the Scarecrows would be on there way towards becoming a proper PMC, intent on making a name for themselves among the stars.</li><li><b>October 2203:</b> Returning to Horizon the newly formed company would buy the rights to the Gyvolis Mechworks. Beginning it reconstruction towards producing a newly created project Celestial, there first attempt at a automated defense system. Making it into a factory to also support increased production of there armor, hiring local populace to work the factory they came into more luck then just that. Having heard word of the reborn Temple armor a number of Syndicate Guardsmen who had gone off to do other work flocked to the new formed group. This would permit a growth in operations for the group as they made a name for themselves. They would also work out a contract with the local populace of Horizon to act as there first Clients helping in the development of a local militia to help protect the colony encase of future attacks.</li><li><b>December 2203:</b> The Company would do its first testing of products and train new found members on handling there gear. Making use of Phase 2 armor they would produce uniquely for themselves, they would test out gear against new test type armors and Custom Loki models being prepared for Project Celestial. This operation would have mixed results some armors showing more promise and odd programming in the Loki models. This would ultimately lead to Phase 3 Production of the Temple series the following year based of the results gained during the op. Given there testing they would take up a few large scale operations dealing with pirates for clients in the Terminus systems, gaining a bigger Client base and building up more.</li><li><b>July 2204:</b> The group would once again see large production of there Project Temple with the completion of the Phase 3, a more prominent version there its forefathers it would play a prominent sales piece that month leading to some customers growing interesting in out right buying the rights to its complete use. Due to interest in its contract it would be taken off the open market to await dealings with larger client that could lead to a full blown growth of Scarecrow from a small group to a true PMC.</li><li><b>October 2204:</b> Finally having gained a foothold with a important client, Scarecrow along with there leader Kamyrin would go and meet with the Amun Sovereignty intent on making a very important deal that could lunch them onto the PMC stage. This would be done with the sale of the Phase 3 contract leading to its productions going straight to the Amun military as there main stead armor. This would also permit the Scarecrows to show off there training and ability in the hope of gaining a PMC contract also out of there deal. These deals would be between the Amun's General Crafin Kod'garal and Kamyrin, as the groups set up a testing area to show of the promise of the armor, along with the Scarecrows abilities and even there newest product Project Celestial. The General showed great favor towards the armor and its capabilities, even going so far as to show a keen interest in the custom Loki mechs which had been built for the scenario. This lead to Scarecrows first major contract, well not military oriented and instead simply supplying a colonial government with armor it still scored a number of smaller contracts with others who now saw Scarecrow as a PMC player.</li><li><b>December 2204:</b> Now with a contract that could give them steady funds Scarecrow set off on producing a second facility on Horizon to act as a training center, in the future to train militia's but for now it was aimed towards training new members and former syndicate guardsmen. A new military doctrine needed to be enforced, given the company had been lax with its own training and disciple, they quickly began to recruit more people to join there ranks and train them from the ground up to be specialized in specific combat styles. This led to the creation of the Crows and numerous sub jobs that aimed towards a individual being specialized for certain situations such as guarding POI's, private security, pirate hunting, and colonial defenses. With the Crows being the military arm of the PMC it also began to recruit engineers and developers to assist with the development of new security measures that would lead it to gain new contracts, during this time Scarecrow would become a official PMC as of prior only being a band of mercenaries and engineers. They sharpened themselves into capable of taking on necessary jobs, though never taking on jobs that felt criminal in activity. This would lead to the Scarecrows gaining a White Knight like appearance to employers, which lead to some not being interested in them and others fully supporting such a security company.<br>February 2205:[/b] Having spent the last 4 months developing a new structure and training routine for its newly grown numbers, its Crows had become a more disciplined force and the company side had become stable. Finally opening up the training grounds of the new horizon facility to the public it took its first batch of trainees from local horizon militia raising them up to have a much more capable unit protecting Horizon, beyond the local Scarecrows stationed there. It had also gained more former syndicate members and still making use of Temple Phase two armor, they began to plan for the construction of a new series that could separate the PMC from the Amun military that now made common use of the Phase 3 armor. This would not be implemented for a number of months but would begin planning during this time.</li><li><b>March 2205:</b> The Scarecrows are hired by the Batarian Reformers to assist with their civil war, with the Alliance civil war brewing the Scarecrows are initially disinterested with the contract but deciding they need the extra funding they send a number of military advisers to assist in the civil war. Later that month also sending a unit of Crows to support guarding important military points that lie within Reformer hands, but aside from this see little too no combat in the civil war. Well that Civil war continues the Scarecrows look towards the Alliance civil war, not knowing which side to support they find a many civilians entering their Saga complex to train under the pretense of mercenary work, many of which support the Attican insurrectionist side. Figuring that the war had not fully gone all out they stay on the side lines to see which side to join with, but continue to train insurrectionist who come to them, stating they are simply training them in self protection though they do get a good amount of heat from the Alliance military over the training.</li><li><b>July 2205:</b> Scarecrows lunch a operation against Pirate forces controlling a former GI shipyard within the Terminus systems Sowilo System, intent on taking over the facility to begin production of their own anti-piracy forces. It becomes heated week long battle as Crows fight through corridors of entrenched pirates that used the facility to supply their own forces, though with supplies running out on the cornered Pirates they begin surrendering and later the facility is captured. Using this as the beginning several other operations are led against former and lost GI facilities that had been forgotten during the Reaper War hoping to expand their facilities in the Terminus systems and expand their own power, though not all operations are a success its seen as enough to make the Scarecrows a force within the Terminus Sowilo System having pushed out major pirate forces present.</li><li><b>October 2205:</b> With the Civil War just around the corner, with fresh resources from the Rachni from their assistance in Suen and old blueprints left by G.I. The Scarecrows are successful in the construction of a somewhat decent but rushed naval power, with this growth leads to a growth in contracts and a larger built up of resources and manpower. Much more powerful than they had been years prior they begin to send advisers to the insurrectionist encampment to help train their new growing military. Knowing this will cause issues with the Alliance, Scarecrows pull out of Horizon and sell of their facilities moving to new facilities in Sowilo system distancing themselves from Alliance retaliation for their support of the rebels. With their support the Scarecrows are able to grow further as Terminus interest that seek to see a free Attican space and create a border between Citadel and Terminus space flock to the Scarecrow ranks.</li><li><b>December 2205:</b> Having announced their official support of the Insurrection and plans to deploy troops alongside the Attican forces. The Scarecrows begin their deployment throwing their full support behind the Attican state they stop assisting the Reformist of the Batarians, fearing that they might support the Alliance. Scarecrow also begins using its naval assets for privateering operations keen on increasing the Atticans states naval power without completely losing theirs in the start of the war, having worked hard to develop what they had.Working with Syndic the crows are ordered to recapture a old colony known as Mir that had fallen during the Reaper conflict years earlier. Well the battle took resources away from the civil war the crows still took part and handled clean up operations on the planet to further establish good relations with Syndic.</li><li><b>January 2206:</b> With the war continuing to spiral into a bigger and bigger conflict, Kam knew the Crows would be crushed in direct confrontation. Having kept to their privateering operations through would not garner much respect or interest from the Atticans. Her only hope was to expand her numbers so when the Crows were finally forced to make a stand alongside their allies they would do such ready. To those ends she search for ways to increase the Crows strength. Later that month she would meet Sanno, a former Dust Marked Colonel and a leader of one of the Remnants of the Skulls known as the Lost and Damned. Unlike the other factions they had no interest in becoming another Skulls and instead sought to keep the Terminus free from another org with similar interests of terror. This aligned with the Crows interest in establishing more order in the Terminus region and together they struck a deal.</li><li><b>March 2206:</b> Well the merge in the prior months had increased the Crows power base and made a way for former skulls to join their ranks. It flooded the Crows with fresh blood, requiring for a expansion that needed more money. But it was a problem that Kam though she could handle later, the last few months the Crows had made little appearance aside from assisting in the training of the Atticans. With Operation Skeleton Key the Crows made their first direct engagement with the System Alliance to further test new equipment under production such as the Odin and Albus Fighters. The Crow would see the Operation succeed and would return to their isolationist build up for the planned conflict over Akuze.</li><li><b>May 2206:</b> With the Crows thanks to their leader and conditions in the Terminus gain control over Syndic, a former allied company that had also been a remnant of the Syndicates fall. Having been aimed at colonization efforts in the Terminus they worked closley and for this reason when the former CEO stepped down Kam took control and merged the two groups together. Gaining a HQ and strong footing on their most recent colony of Mir which had been rebuilt in the last few months.Along with this Kam gained a great deal of financial gains from the take over and even got gained from colonies that had been clients of Syndic. The Crows took over protection of the colonies in Syndics place and helped establish colonial governments to handle the planets over all administration in Syndics place. Becoming strong supporters of the Crows and good clients as the Crows continued to grow.</li><li><b>June 2206:</b> Using their gains over the years, from their dealings with the Quarians, Atticans, Selachi Industries, Amun and many other clients throughout the Terminus the Crows rapidly grew. To further establish their naval presence they did research into how to produce them as quick as possible for Akuze. But it was found straight out producing them would take far too much time and instead they put effort into investigating were old confederacy ships built for the fallen Terminus power had fell. This search lead them to BDH&amp;S which had acquired a great deal of G.I's old assets. Being a System Alliance supporter the Crows knew it would be hard to get the assets and instead thought of several plans to acquire the vessels and gear. The method they choose was to work a deal with Amun to act as a middle man and buy the former Confederacy ships unarmed and rearm them once they were in Crow hands. But they also saw a chance to extend this to the Atticans and approach their government about getting a large sum of credits to also buy several ships for the Atticans. Given the Crows ability to acquire ships for the Atticans and the trust they had garnered doing such the Atticans permitted it and gave them 5 Trillion to acquire some vessels for the Atticans. Than using Amun they handled the actual deal and gained very large number of former confederacy warships that were unarmed and seeing this as a massive chance they choose to work as hard as possible so the fleet was ready for the coming conflict. Intent to keep this as a surprise to the System Alliance the Crows kept some of these facts from the Atticans and well it made them feel like the Crows had turtles to protect themselves the truth of the matter was much different.</li><li><b>October 2206:</b> Slaving away to ensure they were prepared the crows went from being a few million to being tens of millions of troops and personnel all in preparation for a single counter attack. Their fleet had gone from a few dozen to a few hundred war vessels. But the effort to rearm and build up and train the massive influx heavily was taxing the Crows. Not only did they need to further establish their training sites in Sowilo System and on Mir, they also needed to kick their shipyards into full gear and get help on the side from Selachi industries just to ensure the ships would be prepared by the end of the year. But neverless Kam felt certain when the Crows finally made their move both sides would be caught off guard by what they brought to conflict, a fact she very much enjoyed and well the Crows still had troops stationed in Akuze training Attican troops when compared to what they had building up it was but a small fraction of their troop strength.</li><li><b>December 2206:</b> with the fleet nearly prepared and word spreading of Akuze soon being targeted the Crows knew they were on the last stretch and continued their build up but given their condition they knew it would not be finished before Akuze got invaded and only hoped that Akuze could hold out for what would come. Out of all the ships they had acquired only a fraction was back up to its state of the art condition and prepared for war. The troops were continuing their training and more were still coming, with the Terminus becoming more keen on seeing a Attican victory if only to ensure their own protection. The next year would show the Crows efforts in full blossom and they would see how far all their effort would get them in the coming months.</li></ul></span></td></tr></tbody></table>[spoilers=OOC Notes]<ul><li> Current Img is a hold img that is mine until the commission of the actual logo is finished.</li><li>Due to the company's involvement in the SACW, some historical information might be added later based on what happens in the war.</li><li> Changelog:<ul><li> #/#/####: #</li></ul></li></ul>[/spoilers]</div><br><br><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Reference 2</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><table><tbody><tr><td><center><br><br><span class="imagedim"><img style="height:500px; width:auto" src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Scarecrow Securities_files/fli8T0l.png"></span><br><br><span style="font-size:17pt;line-height:100%"><span style="font-family:Century Gothic"><span style="color:Orange">Scarecrow Military Assets</span></span></span></center><br></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td><center><span style="font-size:13pt;line-height:100%"><span style="font-family:Century Gothic"><span style="color:Orange">Ground Assets</span></span></span></center><br><center><img src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Scarecrow Securities_files/Z6oDiM9l.jpg" border="0" alt="user posted image"><br><br><span style="font-size:9pt;line-height:100%">Scarecrows common military forces are classified as 'Crows' a common term for them, well there numbers might be smaller then most other PMC's they favor elite small strike teams then large numbers. Using advance technology and squad based tactics to take down large opposing forces the Crows are specialized in Digging in a defending clients property and the client themselves. Mirrored by the fact they use heavy armor, they favor body guard and security over wet work operations or assaults. The majority of the Scarecrows offensive and defensive strength come from the Crows which are a majority of the personnel within the PMC, many of the members leading into the Civil war are Syndicate Veterans, Former Bacalou Skulls and military Veterans of the Reaper War, ensuring the Crows always had well trained personnel on hand. Thanks to having so many members from divserse military backgrounds ensures the Scarecrows military training program is top class using training from System Alliance, Syndicate, Confederacy and Bacalou Skulls to make their troops a dangerous but military force in the Terminus. <br><br>Above the Crow's lies their elite brothers and sisters that also perform duties of officers within the Crow's command structure. Created through a mesh of training from DOST, Geist, Dust Marked and N7 Operatives the Ravens as their known as a extremely well trained and dangerous elite force. Rivaling many other nations special forces they are considered some of the best body guards a clients could acquire from dealing with the Scarecrow's. Given top of the line gear that is even better than the Crows bellow them only ensures they are a deadly fighting forces, along with training as officers every single one of them is capable of assuming control over a Crow unit and ensuring its used to its best abilities.<br><br>Well the Scarecrows norm is defense, they have developed offensive means to ensure they can expand their business, developing the Corpus unit to act as their sword and wet work operatives. Many of which were trained by Tyche, Nich or other former Assassins, some of the Corpus themselves were even former wet work operatives or Assassins. Trained to work in small teams of 4 men, they can be tactically inserted in hostile locations and cripple enemy structures or targets, well not as elite as the Ravens they are seen as a more dangerous element then their Crow brethren.<br><br>Will'o'Wisps are the least known group of the Scarecrows, rivaling the Corpus unit in size even possibly larger, the Wisps started out as the Scarecrows Omega branch. Given a new name they were meant to watch over Scarecrow interests on Omega without alerting the Big three to the Crows presence. Having grown considerably they have become the Crows intelligence service with many of their members rivaling Corpus, and Crow agents in combat ability but much more secretive about their activities than their crow brothers. They also feature a large number of Raven skilled personnel making them a well tuned intelligence agency capable of black op missions without requiring additional support from Ravens or Corpus. Though often enough the Wisps are placed in command of all Special forces operations, assembling the correct Wisp, Raven and Corpus mix to get the job done when it is necessary.</span><br><br><img src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Scarecrow Securities_files/CDb30gul.jpg" border="0" alt="user posted image"><br><span style="font-size:8pt;line-height:100%"><i>From Left to Right, Officer Crow Standard Uniform, Crow Standard Uniform, Support Personnel Standard Uniform</i></span><br><br><span style="font-size:9pt;line-height:100%"><b>Officer Crow</b> Wearing this uniform marks the individual as a officer within the Crow's unit, leading normally a squad of standard crows. The uniform is what many Crow officers wear outside of combat, capable of being used as light armor it can take a few number of blows before completely being useless. Being adopted by the Scarecrows in 2205 as a upgrade edition of Temple series armor meant for Scarecrows expressed use it has since been updated to the Odin Series armor. This has lead to a increase amount of protection, though its seen as unfit for active use in combat zones. When outside of battle it is seen as the required uniform of the day this is to separate crows on guard duty from off duty crows, and in the off chance of them coming under attack the Crow can participate in battle or at least survive tell they acquire their proper armor.<br><br><b>Crows</b> Wearing their standard unfirom is seen as the norm within a Scarecrow base or facility, well it is seen as light armor it was made to be as comfortable as possible. This led to a decrease in its defense but was seen as a worth while sacrifice to ensure the crows wore it when outside of their direct combat duties. The mask of the armor also acts as a limited time rebreather permitting the crows to operate in toxic situations or limited time in space in the off chance their location is attacked by chemical weapons or they are thrown into the dark of space. Its also the common armor used in martial training due to the fact its much more flexible then most other armor's fielded by the Scarecrows. Also Crows are not required to wear their Masks when off duty but are required to have them on their body in some way in the off chance they come under attack, though if the location is seen as hazardous or dangerous they can sometimes be required to wear it at all times.<br><br><b>Support Personnel</b> seen as the non combatants of the PMC, they can be anything from admin to technicians working on vehicles, required to wear their standard uniform when in a dangerous location or well aboard vessels. This is to ensure that even a non combatant can survive a fightfire in the off chance a Scarecrow facility is attacked, featuring less armor then the Crows standard uniform. Due to the fact the Scarecrows field such a large amount of vessels, vehicles and mechs they are fielding a far larger support staff then most other PMC's of their size. This is also partially due to the fact they aim more towards developing and defending their clients then being simple muscle heads like other contractors that operate out of the Terminus.</span><br><br><img src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Scarecrow Securities_files/cpbiub2l.jpg" border="0" alt="user posted image"><br><span style="font-size:8pt;line-height:100%"><i>From Left to Right, Crow Police, Crow Demolitions, Crow Bodyguard</i></span><br><br><span style="font-size:9pt;line-height:100%"><b>Crow Police</b> are the simplest job within the Crows ranks, hired by their clients to act as police forces for their new colonies and sometimes small cities. They are trained in non lethal combat and make use of a armor that is considered light, well more armored then the Crows standard uniform, its made more to handle nonlethal attacks such as gas, stun and brunt trauma. Many of the Crows that are placed as Police are trained to handle civilians and are much better <i>person people</i> which can handle anything from arresting to riot like situations. Most are also equipped with non lethal means of attacks such as tear gas and stun guns instead of actual fire arms in less their in a lethal location which could be attack by pirates or criminals in which case they will be armed with lethal means of force.<br><br><b>Crow Demolitions</b> Unlike other PMC groups demolitions experts the Scarecrows are trained more towards disarming planted explosives then planting them. Though given their extensive training to disarm such things they also can make great use of the explosives if need. Many are hired along with Crow Police by clients normally only two man teams to ensure that on the off chance a bomb is placed on client property the Police forces can handle such dangers, though they can also find themselves alongside more conventional military forces to handle explosive though then they might be equipped with more standard armor. Unlike the police armor they make use of more padding and protection from explosives then from direct attack, this lead to them being easier targets if directly attacked, though it would be suspected a location they would be at would all ready be secured by Crow Police.<br><br><b>Crow Bodyguards</b> Much better trained then their police brethren they are capable of working in 4 man teams and are meant to protect a specific target instead of buildings or cities like their police brothers. Using less non lethal means they will ensure their client is protect and eliminate any possible dangers. To this end they are equipped with more armor then the police but not enough to classify it as a medium armor, Given the specialty of their occupation many crow personnel who act as bodyguards don't double as military personnel compared to their policing brothers. This leaves the Scarecrows with a small but specific list meant for only body guarding contracts, when not on a client job they are left protecting key Scarecrow personnel.</span><br><br><img src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Scarecrow Securities_files/OqTfwx4l.jpg" border="0" alt="user posted image"><br><span style="font-size:8pt;line-height:100%"><i>From Left to Right, Crow Male, Crow Female, Crow Marine</i></span><br><br><span style="font-size:9pt;line-height:100%"><b>Crows</b> make up the majority of the Scarecrows combat personnel and when on duty often sport the most common armor within the crows ranks, Odin Series Medium armor. Created specifically for Scarecrows its a costly armor made to protect its user in most environments and is installed with Pattern camo, which was common to many of the Temple armors more special operations types. This permits the user to switch is color scheme and camo to match his surroundings, making the Scarecrows the only PMC not to have a standard color scheme, primary because their armor distinguishes who the operator is. A single crow is seen as well trained and many were Veterans of the Attican civil war fighting for the insurrectionist and later joining the Scarecrows after the war ended, making each personnel lethal and well trained.<br><br><b>Female Crows</b> well not a uncommon sight within the ranks of the Scarecrows many serve non combat roles, though this does not deter many strong willed females from joining the Crows. For this reason Kamyrin had a special edition of the Odin medium armor made, to fit perfectly to female bodies, this is seen as different then many armors which instead are made for both genders. Many female crows are scouts within the crow ranks due to their armor being slightly thinner and lighter, this of course has led to the armor being somewhat weaker in terms of defense its still seen as a effective medium armor.<br><br><b>Crow Marines</b> Due to the fact the Scarecrows produced their own naval fleet, it required specific guards and units to be aboard it as protectors. These Crows are outfitted with a special armor capable of working in space much better then their land based brothers, leading to the Crow Marines. Though much smaller in numbers compared to the land base crows which make up the majority of the PMC's military power, they are still seen as dangerous foes trained to storm pirate vessels and capture to ships though corridor to corridor battles. Also capable of defending their own ships from boarding actions, they are also often found aboard Scarecrow space stations, specifically the Scarecrow shipyards which had formerly been owned by GI.</span><br><br><img src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Scarecrow Securities_files/SAJevXkl.jpg" border="0" alt="user posted image"><br><span style="font-size:8pt;line-height:100%"><i>From Left to Right, Crow Destroyer, Crow Heavy, Crow Extermination specialist</i></span><br><br><span style="font-size:9pt;line-height:100%"><b>Crow Destroyer</b> are troops trained specially for the Odin Destroyer armor which is a power armored version of the smaller version of the Odin series. Due to the armor's powered nature it is a tank of the battle field capable of having weapon systems installed onto it but in so it requires special training that can be long and due to its large cost its limited to only a small number of crows. For this reason when a Destroyer is deployed its seen as a pivot point of combat capable of unleashing a large amount of power upon its enemies well taking a large amount of damage in turn. Only those that are believed capable of handling such a system can be trained in it and not everyone passes the training, also due to its large size and requiring a team to deal with its maintenance its not often deployed to support defense operations instead being used primarily in defense operations.<br><br><b>Crow Heavies</b> are hard targets to deal with making use of the Odin heavy armor its seen as the heavy weapon specialist normally carrying a machine gun or another heavy weapon. Almost every Crow team makes use of at least one Heavy encase the team needs to entrench a position the Heavy is capable of laying down a large amount of fire, but due to its slowness it requires the support of the other crows to cover gaps in its offensive abilities. Also featuring the second heavies armor of the Odin series it is seen as a hard foe to take down, but for this same reason its a more costly edition of the series.<br><br><b>Crow Extermination specialist</b> are trained to use the Extermination armor, another rare version of the Odin series it was made to specifically deal with large swarming enemies. Due the Scarecrows having fought reaper forces before in support of the Rachni it was seen as a needed unit in the off chance the Scarecrows ever fought a foe that tried swarming them ever again. To this end its a specially designed heavy armor that is equipped with a flame throw and capable of burning away entire fields of enemies, though it is also a explosive target when enemy snipers are present. The armor is made to handle intense heat and is well armored to protect the user from exploding, when under heavy fire though when attacked to much it still has a chance of igniting the fuel cells and making the user into a bomb. For this reason its not common for many Crows to pick up this occupation though within every group their is those crazy few, normally used on contracts were burning away dangerous wildlife is required, and kept on call in the of chance of finding reaper forces that were abandoned after the war.</span><br><br><img src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Scarecrow Securities_files/SlVG8ZHl.jpg" border="0" alt="user posted image"><br><span style="font-size:8pt;line-height:100%"><i>From Left to Right, Corpus Sniper, Corpus, Corpus Hunter</i></span><br><br><span style="font-size:9pt;line-height:100%"><b>Corpus Sniper</b> is the lethal long ranged killer of the Scarecrows, like its Corpus brothers these units excel at nothing else then attacking their foe. Trained by Assassins and Marksmans they are some of the best shooters the Scarecrows have and capable of eliminating targets from long distances with their silenced weapons. Using the Loki version of the Odin, there armor lacks active camo and instead has gillie like material, making use of Pattern camo they are trained to not move for days, to this end their trained to not rely on normal stealth tech. Since such technology would take up too much energy to run over such long amounts of time and to this end it was taken out of the armor to ensure its user would not trust it.<br><br><b>Corpus</b> operators all make use of one version or another of the Loki armor, though like their Raven brothers they are permitted to use what ever gear or armor they find necessary to complete their mission. Though many lack the funds to buy extremely expensive armor's and therefore making primary use of the Loki armor, trained to be as lethal as possible they are very well trained in hand to hand and close quarters fighting styles. Capable of eliminating their targets even without a fire arm, they unlike their sniper brothers have a optical camo equipped, expecting to handle quicker missions then them. Working in teams of 4 they also work with at least one Corpus hunter which is a tracker expert, when not being hired by clients to take out specific targets they are testing out new Scarecrow defense technology seeing how well it handles assassins.<br><br><b>Corpus Hunter</b> is a tracking specialist with every Corpus team their is at least 1 Hunter and working alongside every Corpus sniper is one Hunter acting as a spotter for their brother. Making use of the M-6 Custom Stealth drone they are capable scouts and their Loki armor has special visions to permit the hunter to find their target, then direct their brothers in eliminating that target. Much like their Sniper brothers they lack the optical camo and instead only feature the Pattern camo though this is for a different reason primary because their armor is a energy eater due to all the sensory tech equipped to it.</span><br><br><img src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Scarecrow Securities_files/weprJWhl.jpg" border="0" alt="user posted image"><br><span style="font-size:8pt;line-height:100%"><i>From Left to Right, Crying Ravens, Raven Standard Uniform, Raven</i></span><br><br><span style="font-size:9pt;line-height:100%"><b>Crying Raven's</b> are considered the Elite of the elite many of whom were trained by Sarah Redfield and act as Kam's personal guard. They take their role seriously and are always found beside Kam, though small in number then any other unit within the Scarecrows, this is primary due to the fact they are a completely female unit and many believe Sarah's choice in recruits a prime reason. Trained in the practice of bodyguards they take it to a completely different level, many could argue theirs few in the galaxy better at protecting a single person then the Crying Ravens and for a certain reason they can be sometimes hired to protect clients. Though many times this is specifically well known clients that work side by side with the Scarecrows or are personal friends with Kam, for this reason they are one of the least seen but well known members of the Scarecrows.<br><br><b>Raven's Standard Uniforms</b> are very similar to the standard uniform of the crows aside from the fact that their made better and are more expensive then the common uniform. Capable of being used as a normal light armor, they also distinguish Raven's from crows given that the Ravens are commonly used as elites and commanders of crows. Their uniform also is equipped with Pattern Camo permitting them to use it as their stealth armor when doing operations that require a lighter armor then their standard Priest armor. They much like the Corpus are capable of using what ever gear they wish including personally owned weapons and armor as long as they believe it is better for them to use. To these ends some Raven's make use gear they had prior to joining the Scarecrows but this is rare due to the fact the Raven Priest armor is seen as one of the Best Odin armors, though unlike crows Ravens are also permitted to wear regular clothing when on duty, due to their raised status.<br><br><b>Ravens</b> are the Elite of the Scarecrows military forces, being capable commanders they take control of major operations that the Scarecrows units participate in. They also sometimes are sent on crucial or well paid missions to handle specific jobs for clients or even act as elite body guards only being second to the Crying Ravens, Kam's personal guard. Raven's are only taken from Crows that show exceptional abilities and then trained in a manner similar to the Geists of the Syndicate which were once Elites that rivaled Dust Marked. Well the Raven's are not capable of taking on Dust marked, Specters or other groups elites they are still considered some of the best troops the Scarecrows have and in groups should be considered very dangerous and lethal foes.<br></span><br></center></td></tr></tbody></table>[spoilers=Military Numbers]<span style="font-family:Century Gothic"><br><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:100%">Combat Personnel</span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:100%"><ul><li>12,567,150 Crow Regulars(4,267,809 Reserves still under Training)</li><li>3,309,721 Corpus Operatives(2,059,453 Reserves still under Training)</li><li>3,250,542 Raven Officers(1,340,535 Reserves still under Training)</li><li>1,679,460 Will'o'Wisp Operatives(553,705 Reserves still under Training)</li><li>378,678 Naval Crew &amp; Crow Marines(45,056 Reserves still under Training)</li><li>4,095 Crying Raven Officers(775 Reserves still under Training)</li></ul></span><br><br><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:100%">Non-combat Personnel</span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:100%"><ul><li>893,062 Administration &amp; Supply Personnel</li><li>678,745 Labor Personnel</li><li>34,051 Technical &amp; Research Personnel</li><li>14,573 Public Affairs Personnel</li><li>11,607 Medical Care Employees</li><li>8,948 Cyber Security &amp; Programmers</li></ul><b>Total Combat Personnel:</b> 21,189,646 Active (8,267,333 Under Training currently)<br><b>Total Non-Combat Personnel:</b> 1,640,986<br><b>Total Employees:</b> 31,101,465</span></span><br>[/spoilers][spoilers=Crow Equipment]<span style="font-family:Century Gothic"><br><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:100%">Weapons</span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:100%"><ul><li>Dunaxxi-205 Rifle</li><li>FL-3 "Colossus" Assault Rifle</li><li>Legacy Military Grade Weapons</li></ul></span><br><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:100%">Armors</span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:100%"><ul><li>Temple Second Generation Armor(2205-2206)</li><li>Odin Series Armor(2206-Current)</li><li>Deamon Series Stealth Armor</li></ul></span><br><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:100%">Misc Equipment</span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:100%"><ul><li>Celestial Series Mechs</li></ul></span><br><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:100%">Vehicles</span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:100%"><ul><li>Dragoon Hover Bike</li><li>Grail-24/26 MBT</li><li>Albus Support Fighter</li><li>Enca Interceptors</li><li>Bennetti Tactical Dropship/Gunship</li><li>Insularis Tactical Bomber</li></ul></span></span>[/spoilers][spoilers=Crow Ranks]<span style="font-family:Century Gothic"><br><span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:100%">Crow Enlisted Ranks</span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:100%"><ul><li><b>Intiate</b> -Initial entry Rank for all new recruits into the Crow Ranks prior to Officially going through Boot camp</li><li><b>Hatchling</b> -Rank for all members currently going through basic training and advanced course training.</li><li><b>Fledgling Crow</b> -First Official rank for all Crow members that have gone through basic training and advanced occupation training.

Requiring a massive build up over a short amount of time the Crows decided against rebuilding the vessels from the ground up and instead choose to buy the ships from BDH&amp;S though Amun. Given after G.I's collapse many of their products and ships fell into BDH&amp;S control which due to the situation and no citadel aimed military interested in buying the ships of a force that wanted to directly oppose them. The ships were simply declawed and sold on a small basis to people that wanted ships. But this left a great deal sitting around so when Amun approached them as a middle man for the Crows in buying many of the vessels for both the Crows and the Attican states a fact that BDH&amp;S never knew about they permitted it. With this the Crows gained the vessels they needed but had to instead of building vessels refit the entire fleet to meet their needs in the war. <br><br>With the fact the vessels had been meant to be the core of the Confederacies fleet prior to its collapse as a conventional fleet against the Citadel forces the ships are still top of the line warships. But even with this in mind the vessels were not a perfect match given the quick development and never truly being field tested. But with Kam and Selachi who assisted them in the refitting the ships were prepared specifically to challenge the System Alliance ships. Kam even went as far to use the Quarian ships she had gained from the federation to assist with the refits, given Quarian ships being hardy vessels meant to last it has made the Crow vessel ships that might not rival System Alliance vessels in mobility, but instead vessels capable of surviving more hits than ships of the same class. This has made the Crow's preferred doctrine of warfare is to keep enemies at a distance in which they can simply shrug off enemy rounds and slowly wear down the enemies though a battle of attrition. With this the Crows favor high class ships over mass quantity ships which are normally the preferred by many other powers in the Terminus. But has left the Crows as a slightly smaller naval force when compared to their competitors, but in the way of firepower they either rival or easily out match many other Terminus powers.<br><br>Even with many of the ships being former confederacy, not all are, some being captured vessels of the system alliance or even vessels built from the ground up to serve the Crows needs through the assistance of Selachi's company who has taken over many of the productions given Crows being more a military force than a ship building company. The Crow's Albus Tactical Fighter, Bennetti Tactical Dropship, and a few others being built from the ground up to serve their needs and better fit their doctrine of heavy defense.<br><br><b>Structure:</b><br>Given the Crow's being a Paramilitary corporation they often deploy their fleets based of the needs of the clients more than having a specific structure of command. Meaning a fleet could be anything from a small patrol fleet to guard a corporate trade lane to being a massive war fleet to assist in massive battles in the terminus which could amount to most of their naval strength. This means a Admiral of the Crows could be leading a fleet of only 7 cruisers and 5 frigates to commanding most of the Crows naval assets in a single fleet.The only two fleets that are fully structured and always present is the Grail Defense Fleet and the Mir Defense fleet which are always watching the Crows to chief locations of interest from possible pirate attack or aggression from competitors. <br><br><b>Naming Convention:</b><br>Ship Classes-<i>Latin Name for Crows</i><br>Prefix for All Crow Vessels is <i>SNV</i> - <b>S</b>rarecrow Secuirties <b>N</b>aval <b>V</b>essals<br><br>Dreadnoughts/Battleships- Knights of the Round Table<br>Carriers-  Mythological Knights &amp; Warriors<br>Cruisers/Frigates/Corvettes- Historical Knights &amp; Warriors<br></td></tr></tbody></table>[spoilers=Commissioned Vessels]<br><b>Dreadnaughts:</b><ul><li><i>Cornix-Class</i><br>- SNV Arthur <br></li><li><i>Imparatus-Class</i><br>- SNV Lancelot <br>- SNV Gawain<br>- SNV Kay<br>- SNV Tristan<br> <br><b>Battleships:</b><br></li><li><i>Edithae-Class</i><br>- SNV Aban<br>- SNV Agravain<br>- SNV Gingalain<br>- SNV Ector<br>- SNV Safir<br>.....10 More Active Service, 2 Under Construction <br><br><b>Escort Carriers:</b><br></li><li><i>Kubaryi-Class</i><br>- SNV Warwick <br>- SNV Ivanhoe<br>- SNV Kahedin<br>- SNV Cawline<br>- SNV Ganelon<br>.....10 More Active Service, 3 Under Construction<br><br><b>Cruisers:</b><br></li><li><i>Validus-Class</i><br>- SNV Joan <br>- SNV Wallace<br>- SNV Czarny<br>- SNV Drake<br>- SNV Cortés<br>.....35 More Active Service, 19 Under Construction<br></li><li><i><a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/mass_effect_codex/stockholm-class-t12019.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Stockholm-class</a></i><br>- SNV Bismarck<br></li><li><i><a href="https://masseffectuniverse.jcink.net/index.php?showtopic=436" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Isurus-class</a>[i]<br>- SNV Camberg<br>- SNV Winkelried<br>- SNV Payens<br>.....6 More Active Service in limited Run<br><br><b>Light Carrier:</b><br> </i></li><li><i>[i]Florensis-Class</i><br>- SNV Kahedin<br>- SNV Naimon<br>- SNV Ortnit<br>- SNV Pinabel<br>- SNV Roland<br>.....5 More Active Service, 7 Under Construction<br><br><br><b>Light Cruisers:</b><br></li><li><i>Nasicus-Class</i><br>.....60 Active Service, 36 Under Construction<br><br><b>Frigates:</b><br></li><li><i>Violaceus-Class</i><br>.....70 Active Service, 47 Under Construction<br><br><b>Corvettes:</b><br></li><li><i>Typicus-Class</i><br>.....80 Active Service, 62 Under Construction<br><br><b>Support Vessels:</b><br></li><li><i>Orru-Class</i><br>.....26 Active Service, 32 Under Construction<br></li><li><i>Rose-Class</i><br>.....1 Active Service</li></ul>[/spoilers]</div><br><br><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Reference 3</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><table><tbody><tr><td><center><br><br><span class="imagedim"><img style="height:400px; width:auto" src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Scarecrow Securities_files/jPGw8AY.jpg"></span><br><br><span style="font-size:17pt;line-height:100%"><span style="font-family:Century Gothic"><span style="color:Orange">Scarecrow Property &amp; Relations</span></span></span></center><br></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td><center><span style="font-size:13pt;line-height:100%"><span style="font-family:Century Gothic"><span style="color:Orange">Property</span></span></span></center><br><center><img src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Scarecrow Securities_files/nrfBgcBl.jpg" border="0" alt="user posted image"></center><br><br><b>Description:</b><br>When the Scarecrows were initially created they only made use of their mobile HQ the White Rose a former Gyvolis ship, owned by Kamyrin Gyvolis prior to the groups formation.

Having captured former GI shipyard present in the Sowilo system and a number of other former GI facilities, turning them into key Scarecrow facilities to support the ever growing PMC company. Now the Scarecrows have become the Established power of the Sowilo system, having repaired its refueling station and a number of key facilities across the planets and driving off Pirate forces. Along with the capturing of the system the Scarecrows. After their merge with Syndic the Crows have set up a headquarters on Mir along with building a strong present around the colony.

Well it has gained a great deal of fresh blood the mix of these peoples ideal's has lead to a slight warp in the Crows ideals. Originally meant to be a company that simply wanted to produce automated defense systems for clients and train people to defend themselves instead of being outright paramilitary army. They have become that very thing mostly due to the members they took in and their ongoing presence in the Attican conflicts having to produce a army capable of fighting with the System Alliance. Now becoming more of a Terminus power with strained relations with the Citadel, unlike many other PMC's the Crows take pride in their own ideology. One were they seek to create and preserve order in the Terminus but keep it free of Citadel power. Never will they take a job that would harm innocent people which they often consider many of the colonist and actually prefer or sometimes even go out of their way to defend. But that does not mean they will not do under handed or outright illegal methods to accomplish their goals. The most simplest difference between them and other's like the Blue Suns, Blood Pact and Eclipse is their in it less for the money and more for the ideals that the Crows are formed around. These leaves them more likely to take jobs for less if they align with their ideals and often leads them into direct engagements with most Pirates and other PMC's, a fact they slightly enjoy due to their origins. Many Corporations trust them due to the fact they never go back on their contract and never switch sides due to money, though some more shady companies have a problem with this.For this reason well not seen in good light by the Citadel they are the Knights of the Terminus by many simple colonist that simply want to create a life beyond the Citadel for one reason or another. <br><br><center><b>Relations:</b></center><ul><li><span style="color:green"><i>Allied Relations</i></span><br>- <b>Attican Insurrection:</b> Choosing to side with the Rebellion early into the war seeing the merit of creating a wall against the System Alliance for the Terminus. They first started the war simply training new Attican recruits and handling privateering operations to further establush the AI. Later into the war they took more direct approaches and actually deployed their troops and navy to assist the AI forces.<br><br>- <b>Amun Sovereignty:</b> With the sale of Temple series armor to Amun's military being one of the main reasons for the Crows foundation and growth has kept the two groups in a close relationship. Also with even acting as middle men in the purchase of the former Confederacy ships they continued support has permitted the crows to prosper. <br><br>- <b>Blades of Lao:</b> Well the Crows are unsure how much they can trust the Skull's remnants and given many members joined their ranks they have a uneasy alliance and training deal with the Blades.<br><br>- <b>Death's Eye:</b> Given the Crows dealings with Death's eyes they feel a better established Alliance with the Dust Marked Remnants than the Blades who are more Chaotic in nature.
