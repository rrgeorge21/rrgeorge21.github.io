<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="SPECIAL_ABILITIES.2C_POWERS">SPECIAL ABILITIES, POWERS</span></h2>
<p><b>True Magician</b>: Hadrian can draw upon the power of the Sixth Magic "Power of Cosmos" to wield numerous soul type or based powers:<br>
</p>
<ul><li><b>Materialization of the Soul</b>: Allows the user to exist independantly of the body and offers a sort of spiritual immortality. Even the loss of the body can be counterd by building a new body out of spiriton particles. This also grants him the ability to eventually replicate any soul based skills, powers, or even equipment.</li>
<li><b>Hyper Awareness/Reinforcement</b>: He is able to sense danger warning him of nearby and immediate threats, sense the mental state of nearby creatures, and the natural energies that flow through a planet allowing him to sense seismic, natural, and weather patterns around him. He can enhance his physical senses as well, using it to track or recognize scents he may have encountered, to hear greater distances or frequencies he might otherwise be unable to detect, and allowing him to see further and with more clarity.</li>
<li><b>Brilliant Mind</b>: Gifted to Genius Level, has continuously won fights in which he is outclassed using cunning strategy and an insanely adaptive thinking set. Has repeatedly outsmarted beings which can live thousands of years. To many he would be considered a consummate general and was arguably one of the most imaginative strategists and tactician amongst his fellows.</li></ul>
<p><b>Guardian</b>: Reborn as a Risen then Guardian, he also picked up a mastery in numerous weapons skills and computers. Hadrian is a master swordsman usually combining with his speed and acrobatics. He is also a precise marksman, personally perfering mixing assault rifles and pistols.<br>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Abilities">Abilities</span></h3>
<p><b>Immense Spiritual Power</b>: The energy released by the soul, often used to augment physical skills and energy blasts. It is connected to the Light as the Light is the very spark of life. With specialized training, he has grown 
</p>
<ul><li><b>Energy Manipulation</b>: He can project raw energy in various forms, mostly as types of blasts or to reinforce his physical durability. Hadrian can also use the Light to enhance himeself to lift and throw 800 lbs to 10 tons, run 30 to 80 mph, jump 10 to 50 feet (Without Force Jump/Leap), leap 20 to 100 feet (Without Force Jump/leap), withstand blows, hard impacts, falls from high heights, heal from injuries faster and smell better, see farther and hear better.</li>
<li><b>Hyper Intuition</b>: He possess a sixth sense of the world around him that combines with his precognitive abilities for an unusually precise and astute analysis of situations, environments, and people. It also operates very much like granting him Sherlock Holmes levels of attention to details and intuition.</li>
<li><b>Seizongan</b>: Like Sharingan, it grants the user an incredible clarity of perception, allowing the user to pick up on subtle details. This gives a boost or heightened sense of reaction timing, accuracy, reading the movements of the incoming target(s) or opponent(s), allowing them to evade or counter accordingly with thoroughness envied by many who worked for that kind've reflex timing. It's second ability is that it grants the user an eidetic memory. The final ability granted is a type of supernatural energy sight which also grants a resistance to illusions.</li>
<li><b>Aura, Light of the Soul</b>: Gives the user a powerful, tactile field around their body, capable of increasing strength, speed, durability, endurance, agilty, reaction times, combat awareness, and a limited healing factor. Once this field is broken, he retains all physical enhancements except the damage reduction field.</li></ul>
<p><b>Aspects of the Light</b>: Hadrian can tap into paracasual force that ties together the Universe and all life within it. It's power dwells within his soul allowing him to tap into the universal forces in the form of Light.<br>
<ul><li><b>Void Light</b>: Hadrian can mentally draw upon Void Light to wield dark energy to create and manipulate mass effect fields as biotic skills. Most biotic abilities fall into three categories. The simplest are instinctive abilities, such as barriers, biotic martial arts, and direct kinetic effects like telekinesis. These rely on a direct manipulation of mass effect energies. More complicated are invoked effects, which require some level of control over the field, such as warp fields, biotic explosions, and other indirect applications. These use the body's nervous system to shape the field, almost like a pulsar field. The most complex biotics are evoked effects, which use the fields to directly manipulate energy or gravity as a force instead of upon an object. The most spectacular effects of biotics, such as singularity or blaze, fall into this category.</li>
<li><b>Solar Light</b>: Having been trained to draw upon Solar Light, Hadrian can manipulate quantum energy for both healing and empowering purposes as well as explosive blasts. He can manifest and shape the light very much like a flame increasing its heat to star levels of temperature. He can also expel the light into the form of flaming jets for flight and create a solar light hammer that can send out seeking blasts of energy. The Solar Light can also be used on touch as an energy strike or to heal others of wounds, or even to form types of solar explosive "grenades".</li>
<li><b>Arc Light</b>: Having been taught to use Arc Light, Hadrian can draw upon the Electromagnetic Field of an entire Solar System for various electromagnetic abilities such as blasts and beams of electricity. He can nullify magnetic properties and use his connection to the EM Field to mentally influence and control mechanical devices and even augment their power. Due to his high level of skill with Arc Light, he can even increase his speed to the point of "Blink" teleportation as well as gaining the ability to see into the EM Spectrum (mostly Ultraviolet Vision). It also disrupts any mentally affecting powers such as mind control and mind reading and can even cause weather changes.</li></ul>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specializations">Specializations</span></h3>
<p>These are the various mystical specializations Hadrian has access to in order of the most skill to the least:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Dawnblade</b>: The Dawnblade is a Solar-based Warlock subclass that grants the Warlock flight abilities, and access to a flaming sword that projects blasts of Solar energy. They can also draw upon the powers of a Sunsinger, a child of the sun, gifted with the ability to restore and take life.</li>
<li><b>Voidwalker</b>: Those who have stared into the Void are not bound by the laws of space and time. It focuses on the manipulation and use of Void energy and is also able to use the life force of their victims to fuel explosive power, the Voidwalker is outfitted with an array of abilities that allow players to sow widespread destruction.</li>
<li><b>Stormcaller</b>: Warriors that specialize in drawing upon the powers of the storm to channel lightning to strike down their foes. Their very presence can summon atmospheric storms and can even manipulate those energies into raw beams and blasts as well as augmenting their body and even teleporting.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Talents">Talents</span></h3>
<p><b>Runes of Battle</b>:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Quicken</b>: The psyker twists time, their outline blurring as they and their fellows move like phantoms across the field. </li>
<li><b>Enhance</b>: The psyker enhances the combat skills of his allies</li>
<li><b>Conceal/Reveal</b>: The psyker takes command of the darkness around them, using it to conceal their kin or reveal any opponents who skulk in the shadows.</li></ul>
<p><b>Runes of Fate</b>:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Guide</b>: The psyker twists the strands of destiny to their will, picking out targets from amidst the swirling chaos of battle and guiding the shots of his allies to where they might do the most harm.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="NOTABLE_ITEMS">NOTABLE ITEMS</span></h2>
<p><b>Warlock "Illicit Reaper" Suit</b>: An armored clothing of Guardians, generating electromagnetic waves and fields to repel attacks aimed at the user. They have limited energy per wave, which is why bullets and small destructive waves are blocked without problems, but no more powerful explosions. However a Guardian's Light can easily recharge these fields given a few short seconds. These can also be upgraded to include a uniquely enhanced heavy armor that acts as an extra layer of protection including various metal enchanted armor, laser and spatial barrier shields and garments that provide high protection against physical, elemental and spatial attacks. It also offers a variety of new abilities such as: 
<ul><li>2,7 times more Armor Resistance and heat dissipation.</li>
<li>200% more mobility, with new nano system that helps improve abilities, graviton system in the boots and a little jump thruster.</li>
<li>Micro-computers, sensors, nano technology, neural system and Virtual Intelligence assistant.</li>
<li>Anti-Indoctrination System and anti-hack.</li>
<li>Ultra Low Weight, thanks to new materials.</li>
<li>Resistance to all weather, radiation, EMP, toxic environment, high and low temperatures. Continuous oxygen capability with new artificial photosynthesis recycler system and filters.</li>
<li>Medigel auto-system and nano auto-repair</li>
<li>Quantum, FTL and normal Communication systems</li>
<li>Cloaking system (but lost the shield and some function meanwhile use this option)</li>
<li>Mini energy reactor with regeneration system (produce or recover energy with movement of the soldier and corporal temperature). Provide the energy for the armor.</li>
<li>Helmet integrates a great quantity of powerful micro-computers and sensors, that help to soldiers in detections, vision, scanner, health, communication, protection, etc. that show the data in the screen.</li></ul>
<p><b>Nemesis Force Katana</b>: The Force Sword exemplifies an amalgamation of sorcery and science. A lighter version, of the force halberd, a force sword can take many forms. Force swords are crafted using arcane magicks and complex scientific formulae and incorporates a powerfield like all Nemesis Force Weapons. The blade is tempered iron, flecked with shards of silver and inset with ancient runes of daemon-slaying. In contrast to these primitive materials, the haft and hilt of the sword contain advanced Nemesis power field generators. Their balanced grips and nearly indestructible construction makes them perfect for parrying even the attacks of even the most powerful supernatural foe. Nemesis force weapons house a psi-matrix attuned to the unique psyche of its owner. The power of the weapon itself directly corresponds to the talent of the wielder.<br>
<p><b>Dual "Better Devils" Hand Cannons</b>: Hand Cannons reward calm technique and sharp shooting. In addition, their abnormally high impact provides them unparalleled stopping power, making them capable of staggering or killing most low-level enemies in one shot. The "Better Devils" is reinforced by an adaptive frame with a explosive payload and can be customised with various modifications such as special sights and stability/combat enhancements.<br>
<p><b>MIDA Multi-Tool Scout Rifle</b>: Scout rifles are semi-automatic precision weapons that fire one round every time the trigger is pulled, considering the magazine is not spent. They are precision machines. From the correct position, the correct state of mind, dropping opponents is like clockwork. The MIDA Multi-Tool comes from an alternate timeline when a revolutionary group called MIDA had ruled Mars and possesses mysterious black boxed enhancements that can boost combat performance and grows with its user.<br>
<p><b>"Tatara Gaze" Sniper Rifle</b>: The accuracy and power of the Sniper Rifle offers the best option for precise ranged attacks. Caliber and make differ, but a good sniper can always remove key threats. They are long-range marksman weapons meant for picking off important enemies at a far distance with powerful headshots. The "Tatara Gaze" was specially constructed in the Black Armory Forges with an aggressive frame and enhanced combat boosters such as the Box Breathing perk.<br>
<p><b>Draymak STI-27 Heavy Blaster Pistol</b>: The STI-27 is unique in the blaster world in that every shot is silent and invisible to the naked eye. It is constructed frmo an alloy of 100-grade Beskar and 40-grade Adamantium. The weapon is extremely tough and deadly and costs a small fortune (or pocket credits, depending on who you are) to own. The clip is small, but highly compact and uses nothing but tibanna gas to fill it. It stores enough gas for 100 shots, though it requires venting by 20 shots or earlier. The weapon is designed without a scope in mind as it comes with an integrated sensor and has been designed to allow it to be molecularly bonded, making it a work of art as well as a weapon. This process increases the cost dramatically.<br>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WEAKNESSES">WEAKNESSES</span></h2>
<p><b>Spiritual Reserves:</b> While Hadrian has an immense reserve, which is theoritically infinite due to "Heaven's Feel", he is limited by how much he can channel at one time, or how much his body/soul can store at one time or how many times it can handle being refiled. However, that amount is slowly increasing as he ages and becomes stronger.<br>
