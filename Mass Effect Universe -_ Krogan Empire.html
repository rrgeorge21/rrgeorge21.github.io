Blite laid much of the ground work for Krogan advancement, this cannot go without saying. The Rebellions required a new course to take...but Blite's would unfortunately doom Krogan for yet another round of the same destruction as last time. In the end, it was expansionism, the very thing he saw as needed to abate Krogan agression, that did him in. His initial commitment and withdrawal from the Systems Alliance Civil War resulted in Krogan who initially supported him turning against him, some calling for his abdication, others for his head. In 2205, Blite stepped down from the throne and retired.<br><br>In his place rose Battlecaptain Urdnot Lorkali. Logical, philosophical, a scholarly warrior taking a strong pulse of the Krogan on domestic policy, though a novice on the international stage. It's now up to this Battlecaptain turned Emperor to lead the Krogan to their future, one that shouldn't result in another Rebellions and their extermination.<br><br><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Timeline</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><br><b>Approx 4000 years prior to 2183</b>: The Krogan, technologically advanced and having overcome the rigors of living on Tuchanka with its hostile wildlife, began fighting each other. The Krogan began fighting each other. A formerly culturally rich people with architectural and artistic achievements of their own fought over small tracts of land because of an exploding population. Krogan destroy their entire civilization in nuclear hellfire, turning Tuchanka into a vast wasteland. Those with Blood Rage, a mental illness as far as Krogan are concerned, become some of the strongest survivors in this post-apocalyptic world.<br><br><b>1 - 80</b>: The Salarians open an unopened relay and discover the Rachni. This starts the chain of events that leads to the uplifting of the Krogan as the Citadel Council's military force in fighting the Rachni, believing the bugs are hostile beyond redemption. The Krogan are given new technology and worlds in exchange for foot soldiers. The year 80 is when Krogan begin arriving in force and begin taking the fight to the Rachni.<br><br><b>81 - 300</b>: The Krogan brutally fight the Rachni, their ability to reproduce with great haste gives them the edge in a fight against the insect race. Krogan fight the Rachni all the way back to Suen and destroy their hives. This leads to the Citadel government declaring the Rachni extinct by 300 and leaving a listening post for possible survivors. The Krogan are hailed as heroes and a statue on the Presidium is raised in honor of their accomplishments.<br><br><b>301 - 700</b>: Off Tuchanka, Krogan, failing to learn from their past, begin reproducing exponentially, claiming other worlds by force. They even begin taking worlds held by other Council members, each time claiming they needed just "one more world" for living space. One such world is Garvug, a formerly lush planet which the Krogan have ecologically ruined thanks to their poor practices in planetary upkeep. The Krogan then began inhabiting the Asari world of Lusia; the Council refused to hand control of Lusia over to the Krogan and ordered them off the planet. Overlord Kredak, Krogan ambassador to the Council, dared the Council to come take their planets back by force and stormed out of the Council Chambers. This act is considered the start of The Krogan Rebellions.<br><br><b>701 - ~1000s</b>: When the Rebellions ended is a matter of debate, some say as late as the 1000s, some say at ~780 when Parthian forces nuked the Krogan world of Canrum. The Rebellions were the first official action of the Spectres, easily able to replenish their numbers against Asari and Salarian forces. It took the newcomer to the spacefaring community, the Turians, to prove a brutal match. Krogan used total war, just as the Turians did, so when Turians faced asteroid strikes against several of their colonies rendering them uninhabitable, the Hierarchy lashed back in kind. The resulting action led to the development of the Genophage and the distribution in 710, the crippling virus killing their reproductive capability. Unable to replenish their numbers, Krogan increasingly quit fighting in the face of an unsustainable war, leading many to surrender by the mid 700s. Rogue warlords continued to fight in the meantime and were brutally put down by Legion forces, others taking their bands and leaving to the frontiers and becoming pirates. In any event, the war was over, the Krogan lost, and were in a horrific post-war position.<br><br><b>~770s - 2203</b>: With the Genophage, and unable to replenish their numbers as before, the Krogan begin their decline. As time goes on, many Krogan believe that without a cure or some change, it will mean the extinction of their people by the end of the 23rd century. Blood Rage has become so pervasive in Krogan society that those without it start becoming rare, but may still come about. This mental illness sees Krogan more focused on fighting each other and militaristic pursuits rather than focusing on reversing the damage. Intellectuals are sneered at and mocked by society. Even the remaining small numbers of Krogan engaged in sciences and philosophy see their own people as a lost cause, but not everyone gives up.<br><br><b>834 - 1017 CE</b>: Blite openly begins to support Breeding Programs for the Krogan, and staying on their planet to fortify their numbers. His words are passed over by other Clan Leaders, who'd rather continue the meaningless violence that aids the Genophage in thinning the Krogan race.<br><br><b>905 CE</b>: Blite spent time turning the remaining members of Clan Woade into the brutal Krogan soldiers known post-Genophage. A great deal of them are killed making strikes of vengeance against the Turians.<br><br><b>900 CE~</b>: The Clans of Vorcha begin to move into abandoned Krogan Clan territories. Hostility begins immediately.<br><br><b><a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Mass_Effect_Universe/index.php?showtopic=10154" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">1012 CE</a></b>: Jark wants to risk the remaining Krogan with a full scale war with the encroaching Vorcha. Blite is forced to make the decision of killing his father and assuming the role of Clan Leader. Blite has some of the clan to observe the Vorcha to check on breeding habits.<br><br><b><a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Mass_Effect_Universe/index.php?showtopic=11034" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">1034 CE</a></b>: Blite (and clan Woade) begins exterminating entire (VORCHA) clans during times of breeding and leaving women alive to raise children, allowing the clans to exist near and help being protected by the Krogan. The vorcha under his protection take the clan name of "Woade" in respect to their new 'protectors.' The arbitrary nature of the Vorcha Clans shifted under the new rule in the Krogan Territory.<br><br><b>1046 CE</b>: Members of Clan Ganar also begin cultivating Vorcha as the Woades had done. (Believe to have inspired Ganar Wrang.)<br><br><b>1073-1137 CE</b>: Blite realizes how short-sited the Krogan are, giving respect for pointless acts of violence. Blite leaves Woade Shaman and his Krantt incharge of the clan lands in his absence, and goes into space to learn through interaction with other races, and try to find a way to inspire his people to become what they have the potential to be.  He finds out about Omega, and it take priority of where he decides to look. Seeing it is governed much like Krogan Territories and Clans, and that it attracted thugs of every race. He was not impressed by Patriarch whom 'ruled' the asteroid. For a ruler he had virtually no visual control, people only listened as far as they had too, not out of respect.  Blite began taking missions with Batarian Pirates whom captured races of each kind and sold them as slaves or looted outright. He learned a lot about the rougish Batarians and even heard a little bit of the skittish Batarian government.<br><br><b>1138-<a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Mass_Effect_Universe/index.php?showtopic=10140" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">1530 CE</a></b>: Blite makes his way to the Citadel and finds residence in the Wards. He takes a job as a bouncer at the Club "Flux." Eavesdropping on larger clients. He also begins working Freelance Mercenary job for several information dealers, and funnels a good amount of money on recent Salarian Scientific Advancements, and classes offered on the Citadel to further his own understanding of the sciences behind the technology. He sends blueprints and orders to his Krantt on Wrill that the Krogan should begin a more rigid teaching program for their young, so they are not stupid brutes compared to the rest of the universe. The blueprints and plans focus mostly on vehicles, weapons, and medical treatment. Though a major blueprint is added, an environmental bubble to eliminate the constant use of breathing masks outside of buildings, and would allow better fortification of Woade Territory.<br><br><b>1531-1767 CE</b>: Blite uses a contact to become a personal bodyguard for an Asari Matriarch, allowing him access to a great deal of Citadel Space, and allowing him to see a great deal of the politics of the rest of the universe, and allowing him to become familiarized with the Asari culture. He was fired for killing a Turian Commander whom insulted him, accidentally. He was challenged and the ensuing headbutt resulted in a crushed skull in the avian species. The Matriarch gave birth to a child of his soon after his termination, one he has never known of.<br><br><b>1770 CE</b>: Blite returns to Wrill to find his clan had successfully constructed the dome providing them with air to breathe inside of it. The intense heat far too much for any other race (excluding vorcha) to withstand out of an environmental suit, so even if pirates were to raid the dome, could be easily disposed of. Another dome began construction, as the Females was going to be sheltered in its own, and guarded around the clock by elite warriors.<br><br><b>1800 CE</b>: Female dome completed.<br><br><b>1837 CE</b>: The Woade Clan begins selling cheap weaponry (through a Middle Man to not allow others to know they were built by Krogan.), providing money for the clan as a whole and the projects Blite had implemented. Krogan of clan Woade being well educated and trained for combat, though most of the children desiring to leave the home world after their rites.<br><br><b>1850 CE</b>: Advanced technology for the vehicles is gleaned from an information Broker that leads the Woade clan into developing hover crafts with a wider range of motion and quicker top speed for raids against the rising gang numbers.<br><br><b>1875-2119 CE</b>: Blite goes to Illium to continue information gathering and jobs to continue funding the clans developments.<br><br><b><a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Mass_Effect_Universe/index.php?showtopic=10689" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">1995 CE</a></b>: Was vowed the allegiance of the clans on Wrill<br><br><b>2120-2170 CE</b>: Blite is offered a large sum of credits in order to eliminate Mercenary Captains on Illium by a well to do citizen who wished to make Illium a 'safer place.'<br><br><b>2183 CE</b>: Blite realizes the Krogan need an undefeatable enemy to make them focus on bettering their species and becoming the force they once were, and returns to Wrill.<br>Krogan are reported to have failed yet another opportunity in finding a cure to the Genophage. Scientists begin increasingly turning to insane options like testicle transplants to attempt to boost the possibility of live young. This is where the general Krogan societal view against intellectuals comes back to bite them. It has been over 2000 years since the end of the Rebellions and still no progress made towards curing the Genopahge.<br><br><b>2184-2198 CE</b>: When Urdnot Wrex begins his uniting of the Clan, Blite personally goes to Tuchanka to offer his support, a few of the Woade Clan members are relocated to Tuchanka as representatives. Blite begins to talk up the Reapers as unbeatable opponents from the tails of Wrex, in order to inspire his clan, he is personally moving throughout the universe to find wayward Krogan, and to convince them to rejoin the Clans and to stop being selfish, as the Krogan will have a battle worth having soon enough.<br>The Corporate War occurs on Garvug in 2185. The end result with loss of life and Corporatist retreat brings in calls for support from other Krogan. With a number of individuals leaving the planet, they stumbled on a gem of a planet in the Terminus Systems: Vorruk. Building themselves up over 15 years, they would later join the Empire in 2200, seeing strength in number and not wanting to see a repeat of what led these clans to abandon their homeworld.<br><br><b>2200 CE</b>:<br>Began process for Project Restoration.<br>Began <a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Mass_Effect_Universe/index.php?showtopic=10545" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Colonization of Virmire.</a><br>Settled policy with <a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Mass_Effect_Universe/index.php?showtopic=10724" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ganar Yulaz</a><br>Claimed the title of <a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Mass_Effect_Universe/index.php?showtopic=10753" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">"Supreme Overlord."</a><br>Met with <a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Mass_Effect_Universe/index.php?showtopic=11179" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kolvant</a> Rutvor about stance on Kolvant clan's disrespect.<br><a href="http://z15.invisionfree.com/Mass_Effect_Universe/index.php?showtopic=10824" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Training of Imperial Forces Begins</a><br>Empire General Assembly begins full-scale productions of various products<br><br><b>2201</b>:<br><a href="http://w11.zetaboards.com/Mass_Effect_Codex/topic/7682364/1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Diplomatic relations</a> are continued with Clan Kolvant to avoid conflict.<br>In an unexpected move with the invasion of the Reapers, the <a href="http://w11.zetaboards.com/Mass_Effect_Codex/topic/7736493/1/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Turian Hierarchy</a> temporarily grants the Empire as a client race to allow the side-stepping of the DMZ to protect Tuchanka.<br>With Imperial Warmaster Ravanor Xarak at the helm, <a href="http://w11.zetaboards.com/Mass_Effect_Codex/topic/7709482/1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Imperial forces</a> begin the systematic destruction of the Reapers present on Tuchanka.<br>Imperial Warmaster Ravanor Xarak, as well as Kolvantic Champion Kolvant Rutvor, seek out the <a href="http://w11.zetaboards.com/Mass_Effect_Codex/topic/7758406/1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">distress call</a> of Kolvant's females in a daring rescue operation.<br>The culmination of combat efforts on Tuchanka prove overwhelmingly successful, resulting in the <a href="http://w11.zetaboards.com/Mass_Effect_Codex/topic/7788542/1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">liberation</a> of the krogan homeworld and Imperial morale soaring with a few newly-made allies.<br>Honoring the pact made with the Turian Hierarchy, Imperial forces and Independent clans more favorable towards the Empire move to Palaven to assist with the <a href="http://w11.zetaboards.com/Mass_Effect_Codex/topic/7992305/1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">liberation</a> of the Turian homeworld.<br>The fighting on Palaven is fierce and takes its toll on allied forces, Imperial morale begins to wane.

A number immigrate and become Imperial Citizens, offered a fine salary for their expertise.<br>One of these migrants, Admiral Mirah Zhenya, a keen innovator and ship designer by her own right, was made Imperial Navalmaster by Emperor Blite.

It keeps the Krogan population viable and leads to greater growth as they expand internally.<br>In 04-2212, the Victoria-class Super Battlecarrier, KIN <i>Primo Victoria</i> is finally complete and enters service, the only one of her kind.<br></div><br><hr><br><br><center><b><span style="font-size:17pt;line-height:100%"><u>Culture &amp; Beliefs</u></span></b></center><br>The Empire is not too removed culturally from what Krogan are. There are still many unique rites and traditions in each clan that have been practiced over the ages. Many of these have been preserved; there are some which are much more harmful for Krogan longevity that were abolished under the previous regime. Though, it should be noted that Blite's government was extremely skeptical of incoming traditions. Skepticism still remains as to the reasons why, ranging from insulting Blite's ego to undermining a sort of religious "godemperor" cult around his personage.<br><br>Lorkali has taken a more muted approach since becoming Emperor, smashing the cult of personality surrounding the Emperor. He allows clans to keep their unique rites and traditions so long as they do not breed conflict with other clans or involve the sacrifice of aliens or other Krogan. This won him some support among a small number of moderately Independent clans who have since opened up negotiations with the Empire. He sees this as a positive forward, albeit a slow step, in preserving Krogan culture while breeding new allies that will hopefully unify. His preference is to deal diplomatically and, in typical respect for Krogan strength, they would come around in due course.<br><br>Old and new begin to meet, and Lorkali is trying to move the people away from resorting to a fight first and never questioning it. It's a new direction, not one favored by archtraditionalists, but a valid direction that, as he sees it, will not get the Krogan killed again out of some senseless lust for war.<br><br><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Imperial Rites and Holidays</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><ul><li>Rite of Birth</li><li>Rite of Passage</li><li>Rite of Graduation</li><li>Rite of Conscription</li><li>Rite of Service</li><li>Rite of Promotion</li><li>Rite of Bonding</li><li>Rite of Breeding</li><li>Rite of Dominance</li><li>Rite of Death</li><li>Renaissance Day - November 11th, 2202 - Celebrated Annually - <i>Marking the date of when the Krogan DMZ was dissolved, it is celebrated as the first progressive step forward for the krogan people in over a millennia and should be cherished</i></li><li>Rite of Challenge - <i>A challenge for the chiefdom of any clan, high-ranking appointed military office, or even the throne of Emperor itself.</i></li></ul></div><br><br><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Imperial Philosophy</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><br>Blite laid a foundation for the Empire's philosophy.

        <div class="postcolor"> <center><b><u><span style="font-size:27pt;line-height:100%">Imperial Armed Forces</span></u></b></center><br><br>Like any Empire, the Krogan require a military.  It is in their blood, warriors built by centuries of adaptation to the harsh reality of the galaxy.  From a homeworld where they are prey, the lowest on the food chain, survival was a day-to-day activity and continues to be so in present times.  Conflict is their way of life.  While most of the galaxy views them as brutal, pragmatic, and in some cases, unintelligent and undeveloped, the krogan are masters of the art of warfare.  They have an affinity, an appreciation for it, and dying in battle against a formidable foe is no greater honor to be bestowed.  They live for the fight, desire strong enemies, and wish there is no shortage in the near future.<br><br>While times have changed, both literally and metaphorically between the advancement of the galaxy and the Genophage impacting krogan reproduction rates, the Empire desired to keep that aspect of their livelihood alive and well.  The Imperial Army harnesses that chaotic aura of a battle-hardened krogan and disciplined it.  The average krogan is quite dangerous and difficult to combat.  An Imperial Trooper is much of the same, multiplied many times over, and follows orders like a properly structured military.  They are not drones, but controlled chaos.  A rule-of-thumb that is followed by the regime is the average Imperial Trooper should be capable of besting up to 10 average krogan warriors in combat by themselves, double that for "lesser" races.  Such success comes at a price, however.<br><br>As decreed by the Imperial Warmaster and forefather of the training regime, each graduating class of Imperial Troopers is allotted up to 20% failure rate to be deemed "acceptable".  The current average failure rate has been curbed back to just 10% with supervision from instructing Battlemasters.  Injuries are down as well with substantial medical staff on standby.  Even krogan can suffer wounds after all. Those who fail to make the grade for infantry go on to serve in other roles during their conscription period.<br><br>In 2206, Emperor Krogan Lorkali reformed the Imperial Military ranking structure. This created distinct Officer and Other Ranks pathways for personnel and makes Krogan forces far more efficient than an odd NCO to Officer path previously implemented, along with rectifying a lack of enlisted level ranks. The current Imperial Armed Forces setup is far more effective than the initial setup.<br><br><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Structure</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><br><br>Each Empire-loyal is allowed to retain its own fighting force. The training varies depending on the clan, as does equipment; some clan forces may put up a strong showing against Imperial Troopers with a possibility of victory, with others no better off than as a defensively-oriented militia force. The Empire asks of each clan 10% of their warriors for conscription into the Imperial Army. Clans tend to send their best, wanting to make a good showing. During training to become an Imperial Trooper, all conscripts first learn that they are brothers in arms, that their clan's name or prestige means little. They will obey the orders of their superiors or they will soon learn a very harsh lesson in reality. Those unable to adapt are usually forced into other duties fit for an undesirable, where those who learn and adapt go on to fill various combat roles, with top scorers in infantry. Those with keen intellect are usually slated for other roles which make the most use of their mind.<br><br>Asari who immigrate to the Empire as full citizens have a similar demand of them under Krogan conscription laws, given they live as long as Krogan can feasibly if not stupid. While they may have a service mandate, they do not have to serve it in the military, but can serve in any government or civil service role as well. Those who serve in the military tend to be careerists, Army and Navy alike, preferring to join for a commitment, rather than a short time. If aliens earn full citizenship within one of the Clans, or even the Empire at large, they are exempt from mandatory service, but may volunteer to serve.<br><br>The building block of the soldier forms the basis, from here, it is up the ladder all the way to the highest echelon, with the Emperor as Commander in Chief of the Krogan Armed Forces. The effort to coordinate the entire military in its day to day operations, as well as to advise the Emperor on military matters is the responsibility of the Joint Chief of Staff. The Krogan exist in a quasi-military controlled state of their Armed Forces, with the Emperor able to issue orders. While the Joint Chief does have the nominal head of the Minister of War, in practice, he answers directly to the Emperor, giving him a direct line to the Armed Forces that sidesteps the civilian appointee. Even if a lower rank than the Imperial Warmaster and Imperial Navalmaster, the Joint Chief is superior in command and will be paid proper respect.<br><br>The current Joint Chief of Staff is Warmaster Nakmor Khuyas.<br><br></div><br><br><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Philosophy</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><br><br>In line with Emperor Blite's own words, as well as Imperial Warmaster Xarak's wise counsel, the Krogan Imperial Military, both Army and Navy alike, follow similar guidelines.  Unlike generations gone by, this is not a gathering of the largest, strongest, most veteran of warriors to throw at the nearest obstacle.  Blite, Xarak, and the High Overlords have used life lessons, experience, and research from across the galaxy to construct a training regime that would harness the raw fury that many knew the krogan for in combat, and turn it into a controllable, malleable force capable of acting as any professional army would. <br><br>Strength without order is chaos.<br>Strength without direction is squandered potential.<br>Strength without discipline is weakness.<br><br>Structure, order, and discipline has sharpened the dulled edge of a blade that was once krogan into something razor-honed and swift to strike with extreme precision and lethality. From reckless, brutal warriors to a well-trained, well-disciplined professional, the transformation of the species' military might into a vision of tomorrow has been something sorely needed and paramount to future success.<br><br>The Empire's primary military force is limited by the War Department's annual budget. Under Emperor Lorkali, the emphasis of the Krogan military has changed greatly; there is no disputing Krogan might on the ground, their technology is strong, their infantry strong; in fact, even the mighty Hierarchy Legions fighting the Imperial Army would lead to a gruesome slaughter in a ground campaign. Lorkali has recognized this, knowing no Council force would willingly send their forces into a grinder, and has shifted emphasis to the Imperial Navy. In the age of RKM weaponry, this emphasis has paid off, with the Krogan developing a unique doctrine to combat the most recent threat, and something that plays to their natural and national advantages. Only time can tell which untested new doctrine would be proven right and if the Krogan Empire may have invested much into a Navy only to see it proven naught but straw.<br><br></div><br><br><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Training and Tactics</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><br><br><center><b>Imperial Hand-to-Hand/Melee Combat Training</b></center><br><br>-<u>Para:</u> A form of martial art  developed by the Krogan, and often only Krogan were capable of performing it. While Krogan were more often known for their exertion of brute force, Para was surprisingly widely known, due to the natural violence of Krogan society and rites. Together with the natural strength of a giant reptile, it made a fearsome weapon. The martial art focused on using the immense upper body strength of the species, with an emphasis on punches, jabs and throws, and usually only a few strikes at a time. Also surprising were the non-lethal options available to the Krogan using the art, practitioners capable of disabling an opponent with a single blow.<br><br>- <u>Living Ram:</u> The style focuses on strong upper-body strikes powered by both muscle and body movement, as well as powerful knee strikes and stomping kicks. Defense relies primarily on avoiding or withstanding attacks.<br><br>The beginnings of Living Ram training are characterized by long, deep stances designed to develop strength in the martial artist's legs. Then, repetitive basic punches and kicks are added to improve muscle memory and develop upper-body strength and overall flexibility. Living Ram teachings were famous for their day-long training sessions where students would stay in a prescribed stance for upwards of ten hours, constantly punching and kicking. As training progressed, students were required to learn how to take blows from each other – as the student climbed in prowess, the blows would become more forceful.<br><br>Living Ram is characterized by hard upper-body strikes and stomping kicks. The attacks are designed to penetrate an opponent's guard through the sheer level of damage inflicted. <br><br>The art's name was taken from a story of the first Master, Jar Dol, who reputedly smashed open a meter-thick wooden gate with one blow of his fist. Because of the nature of the strikes, Living Ram practitioners tend to avoid secondary blocks, and train themselves to dodge or simply absorb attacks.<br><br>Lower-level students tend to dodge more, while more experienced fighters could shrug off most strikes. Masters of Living Ram were legendary for their resilience, able to brush away even the fiercest of unarmed blows.<br><br>-<u>Rolling Boulder:</u>  A more recent addition to the training regime, one instructed and masterminded by Imperial Warmaster Ravanor Xarak.  While Rolling Boulder is not by any means an original martial art, is is more or less his impressive experience and wisdom rolled into a complete package.  After several centuries of traveling the galaxy as a mercenary, coming across all manner of foes of a wide variety of shapes and sizes, Xarak quickly saw the effectiveness of various techniques from different races.  Utilizing this observation and curiosity, he went on to learn as much as possible about them, especially on the rare occasions he was contracted to work with others in a group.<br><br>Essentially, Rolling Boulder is as "un-krogan" of a fighting style in hand-to-hand and melee combat as one can think.  It utilizes not the krogan raw strength and brute force of their size, but the opponent's own inertia against them.  A more defensive, reactive style than offensive, it is meant to preserve as much energy as possible while incapacitating or killing the opponent with as little effort necessary.  Brutally efficient and further enforced by a krogan practitioner, the style focuses upon parries, counters, quick strikes, sweeps, submissions.  Targets are usually opponent joints, bones, and other critical locations meant to break, shatter, or dislocate to neutralize the threat.<br><br>Xarak's goal is to turn an Imperial Trooper with a utility blade into a force to be reckoned with, proving that the krogan are just as potentially lethal without a firearm, but a simple blade or even their bare hands.  It is surprising to see a sense of fluidity about their movements with Rolling Boulder.<br><br>-<u>Armed Melee:</u> There are a number of Krogan martial arts that revolve around the use of weapons, not unlike Asari and Turian traditionalists. Krogan are known more for use of blunt weapons, warhammers and maces for instance, making use of a brutal weapon with a wider surface area to strike a target and bring the most use out of their natural upper body strength. There are also those who prefer the use of bladed weapons from longswords to battleaxes. These arts are meant for one real purpose, and that's to make sure the adversary doesn't get off the ground again. A Krogan even using the pommel of a sword to deliver a knockout strike has a possibility of fracturing a skull, defeating the idea of a non-lethal take down.<br><br><center><b>Ground Tactics</b></center><br><br>The Krogan are a strong military force on the ground. The discipline of Imperial Troopers, the implementation of combined arms tactics, learning from the past and using tactics other than swarm warfare have turned the Imperial Army into a force to be reckoned with. Some military analysts have found that it would take an entire Alliance tank squadron of 4-6 tanks to defeat a single Krogan MBT. The Imperial Army is, at this point, considered to be an equal to Citadel forces thanks to emphasis paid on the Imperial Army in the opening years of the Empire. While emphasis has shifted to the Navy, the Army still continues to train and use artillery, armor, naval and army air support, and infantry in deadly concert with each other. Anyone expecting an easy foe should think twice.<br><br><center><b>Naval Tactics</b></center><br><br>Krogan naval tactics are incredibly aggressive. These tactics have been developed by Imperial Navalmaster Mirah Zhenya before the advent of RKMs with the hope of breaking the stagnation of naval combat by forcing a more dynamic route. Her whole premise was to render the main weapon of an enemy's warship, the spinal gun, absolutely useless. The goal is to close to within 6 kilometers of the enemy (or closer even) in a full assault and then utilize the many cannons typically used for flak barriers to tear an enemy ship to death. Death by a thousand cuts rather than large blows. The Krogan also contributed, of their own design, saturation attacks with missiles from their cruisers. It's a highly aggressive naval tactic for a highly aggressive people, bringing all ships into combat than leave any sitting as targets for their enemy.<br><br></div><br><br><hr><br><br><center><b><u><span style="font-size:27pt;line-height:100%">Armed Forces Branches of the Empire</span></u></b></center><br><br><center><b><u>Imperial Army</u></b></center><br><br>Imperial Troopers are krogan warfare perfected, designed to be as ruthless, methodical, and efficient as possible, utilizing training and tactics rather than numbers due to the Genophage and controlled breeding after it was cured. There is no room for weakness in the Imperial Army, each Trooper must rely upon one another in full and entrust them with their lives.  What they lack in numbers, they make up with superior training and an unbreakable will of determination and sense of duty in loyal service to the advancement of the krogan once more.<br><br>Imperial Troopers are conscripted for service annually from all Empire-loyal clans, taking 10% of their best warriors yearly to supplement them into the training regime, turning the best into the elite.  Enduring the hardships of hand-to-hand combat training, melee combat training with all manner of weapons and tools, firearms proficiency, squad tactics, survival exercises, and all manner of other tests, over the course of 2 months, those that reach the end of the program with a sufficient passing score by overseeing Battlemasters acting as instructors graduate to join the ranks of the Imperial Army.<br><br>Those that fail to make the cut of Imperial Troopers, but managed to survive the training are allowed to attempt as many times necessary.  If they desire not to, they are placed in lesser/supportive roles, such as the Imperial Armored Corps.  For a krogan, while being at the helm of a 300 ton rolling death machine is a dream come true, they have several inches of armor plating and barriers between them and the action, not exactly thrilling or respectable by other krogan of what they do.  All desire to be Imperial Troopers, not all are capable, it is reality.<br><br>Non-Krogan forces, small in number, are organized into rear echelon units. Alien infantry units are extremely uncommon, and are usually platoons attached to second line Krogan units at best. Usually, aliens serve in non-combat duties but can still fight if the enemy comes to them. Though, some officers from Senawuk's Utopiate Eternal Guard have come to the Empire to assist Krogan officers in training their forces in the finer arts of Asari warfare from scouting missions to laying ambushes. The expertise of aliens brought to the table have been welcomed by higher ranking Krogan echelons to turn the Imperial Army into a well rounded force rather than the main Krogan focus on blunt force and overwhelming firepower.<br><br><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Imperial Trooper Loadout</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><br><br><b>Imperial Army</b><br>EGA Resurrection Heavy Armor Mk. 3 (Coloration varies by rank)<br>General-Purpose Omni-Tool (Specialized Omni-Tool for specific roles, i.e. Marksman, Artillery, etc)<br>General-Purpose Medi-Gel Delivery System<br>Spare Power Cells<br>EGA Utility Knife MkII<br>Magnetic Compass<br>Provisions/Rations<br>Thermal Clips<br><br><center><b>Active Duty</b></center><br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 HAWS Assault Rifle (Active Duty Rifleman)<br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 ASG Assault Shotgun (Active Duty Assault/CQC Trooper)<br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 SAW Light Machinegun (Active Duty Support Gunner)<br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 PSR Sniper Rifle (Active Duty Marksman)<br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 HP "Quadstopper" Heavy Pistol (Standard Sidearm)<br>EGA T95 Mod 1 Helix for use by Asari Forces<br><br><center><b>Reserve/Civilian Defense</b></center><br>EGA T94 Mod 2 HAWS (various attachments)<br><br></div><br><br><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Imperial Army Ranks and Color Designations</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><br><b>Current Total Garrison:</b><ul><li>1,950,000 (03-2212 - Continued Growth) - Active Duty</li><li>25,010,000 (03-2212 - Continued Growth) - Reserve/Civilian Defense</li></ul><center><b>Ranks and Color Schemes:</b></center><br><br>Technician ranks were added with the 2206 reforms by Emperor Lorkali.

Under the guidance of Imperial Navalmaster Mirah Zhenya, the Krogan Navy has evolved from a force of no direction aside from causing damage to land on a planet with great haste to a force to be reckoned with. The Imperial Navy developed into a mainly defensive force, but has some offensive capabilities with limited power projection potential in the ability to land a single field army in an invasion at any one time. They are only limited by what the Hierarchy would permit, and Zhenya has very well made her plans known to them. They are not in conflict, but rather in sync.<br><br>Being a respectable size nation for Krogan and still expanding internally within areas they control, the Navy has the means to afford a suitable navy to patrol its many realms. New ships have been built in accordance with what Zhenya had envisioned as her “gray navy doctrine” prior to her becoming part of the Krogan Empire. This doctrine is based on the principle that the best defense is a good offense. Heavily reliant on aggressive ship movements to close the distance and the use of fighters for defense and superiority. This was later coupled with Krogan missile cruisers for saturation attacks. Krogan frigates remain in use as dropships to land troops onto a planet for a mass deployment before departing, keeping out of AAA range as they do so.<br><br>The Battle of Akuze and the Systems Alliance Civil War changed everything with the introduction of a new technology: FTL missiles. While this provides greater usefulness for Zhenya’s tactics in this new era of naval combat, and finally breaks the stagnation of ranged combat, it has thrown her plans into some tumult in reconfiguring the Navy’s size, maximum allowed per ship class, and develop yet more ships of other types to compensate for the new threat.<br><br>Even with some tumult in recent years, this is an innovator’s market in the system right now, and business is booming. The Krogan Imperial Navy is now a fine force suitable for a Grade A government, with Asari naval competency training Krogan in the art of naval warfare and refining those who already have experience. Pirates, raiders, slavers, and Independents should reconsider their life choices if they choose to fight the Imperial Navy.<br><br>In 07-2212, after departure from the Citadel, the Krogan Empire ceased using the KIN prefix on all vessels. Registration of vessels is still kept up to date thanks to close relations with the Hierarchy to allow for identification of Imperial Navy vessels based off the registry. Aside from previous Citadel obligations, the Krogan don't see a need for vessel prefixes. Some exterior writers continue to use KIN when referring to Imperial Navy specific vessels, however.<br><br><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Imperial Navy Loadout</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><br><br><b>Imperial Navy</b><br>EGA General Purpose Hardsuit for Asari Crew<br>EGA Pilot Hardsuit for Asari and Krogan Pilots<br>EGA Resurrection Heavy Armor Mk. 3<br>General-Purpose Omni-Tool<br>General-Purpose Medi-Gel Delivery System<br>Spare Power Cells<br>EGA Utility Knife MkII<br>Provisions/Rations<br>Thermal Clips<br><br><center><b>Active Duty</b></center><br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 HAWS Assault Rifle (Marine Rifleman)<br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 ASG Assault Shotgun (Marine Assault/CQC Trooper)<br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 SAW Light Machinegun (Marine Support Gunner)<br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 PSR Sniper Rifle (Marine Marksman)<br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 HP "Quadstopper" Heavy Pistol (Standard Sidearm)<br>EGA T94 Mod 2 PDW and Export Pistol (Pilot Atmospheric Survival Kit)<br>EGA Type 95 Mod 1 Helix for Asari Marines and crew<br></div><br><br><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Imperial Navy Ranks and Color Designations</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><br><br><b>Current Total Garrison:</b> 575,000 (03-2212 - Limited Growth)<br><br><center><b>Ranks and Color Schemes</b></center><br><br>With the 2206 reforms, Imperial Navalmaster Mirah Zhenya expanded the ranking table to bring the Krogan Imperial Navy to be more in line with that of a typical navy.

While it can be reactivated in a pinch (and already has the internal name of <i>Interior Battleship 1</i> on standby), the Emperor-class becomes more outdated as time goes on and is likely to never see service again. The Empire has also investigated swapping out these ships, which were acquired from Vorruk's clans, for more modern ships to train their crewmen. The change has yet to be made or seen in any action.<br></div><br><br><hr><br><br><center><b><u>Imperial Internal Affairs</u></b></center><br><br>Imperial Internal Affairs, or the IIA, are the upholders of the Empires laws. They ensure that taxes are paid, and that no quarrels amongst clans threaten the stability of the Empire. While clans are still expected to deal with their own criminals within, any group who initiates unnecessary hostilities with allies, or challenges the law set down by the Empire will have the full force of the law brought down upon them by the IIA. Members are recruited into IIA in a similar fashion to how one joins the Imperial Army – they must display certain qualities that the Empire holds in high regard: efficiency in combat, a calm and diplomatic nature, and a cool head under pressure to gain recognition and an invitation to serve. Members are usually veterans of the Imperial Army, though this is not a requirement. Members, as representatives of the Empire, are held to a high standard of behavior and professionalism.<br><br>When not dealing with major conflicts, the members of the IIA operate out of stations scattered all throughout the Empire to serve as an average police force. Having their forces widespread allows them to know the state of the clans and supervise them at all times. All stations report directly to the central government, although every branch is fully capable of operating by itself in the event of a loss of communication.<br><br>Overall, the IIA is a brutally efficient force. They are the glue that holds the empire together, keeping the clans united under the law and maintaining relative peace to ensure infighting does not cause the krogan people to become weak due to instability. Determined to make a new name for themselves amongst the universe as a people ready to cooperate and contribute to the galaxy, the krogan strive for strength through peace and stability.<br><br>With the introduction of Asari from Senawuk, Imperial Internal Affairs has gained the capability in founding an intelligence arm. This agency, creating the jobs of field agents, intelligence agents, and analysts. Some law enforcement personnel also help to refine police activity in IIA. Headquartered at Virmire, the froundation of the Empire's intelligence wing was laid in 2203.

Offspring shall be examined by Imperial doctors and treated as necessary given illnesses or potential defects. The practice of euthanizing set forth by Emperor Blite is henceforth revoked. Breeding percentage shall not exceed two percent population growth nationally.<br><br>Asari citizens, as directed by Emperor Lorkali in 2206, will receive citizenship if born to an Imperial father.

Upon ascension, Lorkali demolished the standing rule, decentralizing the economy and allowing the rise of private enterprise. This change has allowed a capitalist Krogan economy to rise from black markets that previously existed under Blite's system. Within 5 years, the Imperial economy has emerged from a spiraling debt that would have led to a massive breakdown in the economy to a self-sustaining and budding economy with private ventures taking over where government owned ventures once existed.<br><br>Empire General Assembly, once operating under complete government control, has been allowed to act autonomously under government oversight. While Kolvant Garoth is still proud to produce weapons and machines of war, EGA now churns out civilian vehicles, household appliances, and other civilian goods that might be needed within the Empire. Investments made by EGA has helped to boost income, in which they are now starting to see the first returns. Private enterprises have recently been allowed to lease EGA's orbital shipyards, especially with recent orders to expand operations, to build their own vessels.<br><br><center><b><span style="font-size:17pt;line-height:100%">Commercial/Industrial Ventures</span></b></center><br><br><center><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:100%"><b>Manufacturing</b></span></center><br><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Industrial Manufacturing</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><ul><li>Assorted Clan Factories - Multiple Locations</li><li><a href="https://masseffectuniverse.jcink.net/index.php?showtopic=873" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Empire General Assembly - Virmire</a></li><li><a href="https://masseffectuniverse.jcink.net/index.php?showtopic=881" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">EGA Orbital Shipyards, Tuchanka</a></li><li>Mining - Ores and Precious Metals</li><li>Construction/Contracting</li><li>Weapon Manufacturing</li><li>Anti-Matter Manufacturing</li><li>Various private industries</li></ul></div><br><br><center><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:100%"><b>Commercial Tourism</b></span></center><br><br><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Tourism</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><ul><li>Rachni War Tours (Expensive, cruise style)</li><li>Introduction to Rites and Culture (of participating clans)</li><li>Guided Tours of Port Woozin and other Imperial cities of Virmire and Tuchanka</li><li>Tuchanka Hunting Safaris</li></ul></div><br><br><center><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:100%"><b>Exported Goods</b></span></center><br><br><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Exports</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;"><ul><li>Tin</li><li>Copper</li><li>Iron</li><li>Gold</li><li>Platinum</li><li>Palladium</li><li>Iridium</li><li>Element Zero</li><li>Stone ores</li><li>Antimatter</li><li>Firearms</li><li>Military Hardware</li><li>Exotic Pets</li><li>Steel</li><li>Silver</li><li>Aluminum</li><li>Titanium</li><li>Tantalum</li><li>Kathian "Blood Diamonds" (these diamonds have a naturally deep crimson color, likely due to the atmosphere of the planet Kath.

The universe neither threatens nor promises. It holds things beyond our sway: the fall of a meteor, the metamorphosis of a star, growing old and dying. These are the realities of this universe and they must be faced regardless of how you feel about them. You cannot fend off such realities with words. They will come at you in their own wordless way and then, then you will So understand what is meant by "life and death." Understanding this, you will be filled with joy.<br><br>This wise man observed that wealth is a tool of freedom.<br><br>But the pursuit of wealth is the way to slavery.<br><br>What do you despise? By this are you truly known.<br><br>Answers are a perilous grip on the universe. They can appear sensible yet explain nothing.<br><br>Truth suffers from too much analysis.<br><br>To know a thing well, know its limits. Only when pushed beyond its tolerances will true nature be seen.&nbsp; Is obstinate and pointless violence truly the way of the Krogan?<br><br>Some never participate. Life happens to them. They get by on little more than dumb persistence and resist with anger or violence all things that might lift them out of resentment-filled illusions of stability.<br><br>How often it is that the angry rages denial of what their inner self is telling them.<br><br>Uproot your questions from their ground and the dangling roots will be seen...More questions!"</i><!--QuoteEnd--></td></tr></tbody></table><!--QuoteEEnd-->  </div>

        <!-- THE POST 3163 -->
        <div class="postcolor"> Hey RC!<br><br>I like the direction you're taking the empire here and the work you've clearly put into it. Just a couple points of clarification/expansion on a few things and I think you're good to go. <br><br>In the timeline, in particular, I'd like a few things added and expanded upon. Especially as this page will be looked at my new people to the site, who may be less familiar with lore as they are making krogan characters. <ul><li>Even though it is explained, I'd like to see perhaps a little less of personal history of Blite, and more relevant krogan history points in the early timeline. This is simply so that the krogan history page is less the history page of one individual, and more of the krogan as a whole. </li><li>In that vein of thought maybe add pre-empire history, canon points, like the krogan rebellions, for people less familiar with canon lore as well. </li><li>First meetings of "The Brides of&nbsp;Woozin" - This could use some clarification, as I'm not even entirely clear as to what this means/is, and likely others will be confused as well. </li><li>Female Clan&nbsp;- This could use explanation and expansion, as I only see it mentioned here. Is it an entire clan of females? A female dome? Other clans are mentioned as having females, so I'd just like to see clarification here.</li><li>I'd like to see a link to the Victoria-class Super Battlecarrier in the timeline since it comes up more than once in it as a significant mention - I'm also going to wait for approval on it since it is an important part of the timeline seemingly.</li></ul>That's mostly it for the timeline. <br><br>Culture Section:<br>“It is known that Emperor Blite once feared now Pope Callixtus IV when he was Cardinal Urdnot Caldac, Bishop of Virmire when Krogan converts to Catholicism began popping up in the Empire.”<br>-I'd like to discuss this further with you, along with Napalm, as I have a few concerns, but they're complicated to get into here. I'll make sure to get a chat started with you <!--emo&:)--><img src="./Mass Effect Universe -_ Krogan Empire_files/smile.gif" border="0" style="vertical-align:middle" alt="//files.jcink.net/html/emoticons/smile.gif"><!--endemo--><br><br>Laws: <br>“(This is for many reasons: Krogan are suspicious of potential brain fuckery, there is an inherent cultural bias against this as Krogan even believe watching too much extranet rots one's brain, and it could be an issue of contention with Independents. It's one of those things that the Independents and Imperials actually see eye to eye on.)”<br>There's nothing wrong with this per-say, simply that the tone is mostly OOC and informal, in contrast with the rest of the page, so I might suggest slight rewording of this to a more formal stance and government lingo, so to speak, since this is in the laws section.  <br><br>That's it for now, like I said, I'm liking your direction and ideas and look forward to seeing what you do with the krogan.   </div>

This only implied the Empire-loyal clans/factions and their combined territory present on the krogan homeworld.<br><br><br><br><br>History<br><br>Much of the Empire's history leading to its inception is tied up with that of Woade Blite. Blite laid much of the ground work for Krogan advancement, this cannot go without saying. The Rebellions required a new course to take...but Blite's would unfortunately doom Krogan for yet another round of the same destruction as last time. In the end, it was expansionism, the very thing he saw as needed to abate Krogan agression, that did him in. His initial commitment and withdrawal from the Systems Alliance Civil War resulted in Krogan who initially supported him turning against him, some calling for his abdication, others for his head. In 2205, Blite stepped down from the throne and retired.<br><br>In his place rose Battlecaptain Urdnot Lorkali. Logical, philosophical, a scholarly warrior taking a strong pulse of the Krogan on domestic policy, though a novice on the international stage. It's now up to this Battlecaptain turned Emperor to lead the Krogan to their future, one that shouldn't result in another Rebellions and their extermination.<br><br>Timeline<br><br>Approx 4000 years prior to 2183: The Krogan, technologically advanced and having overcome the rigors of living on Tuchanka with its hostile wildlife, began fighting each other. The Krogan began fighting each other. A formerly culturally rich people with architectural and artistic achievements of their own fought over small tracts of land because of an exploding population. Krogan destroy their entire civilization in nuclear hellfire, turning Tuchanka into a vast wasteland. Those with Blood Rage, a mental illness as far as Krogan are concerned, become some of the strongest survivors in this post-apocalyptic world.<br><br>1 - 80: The Salarians open an unopened relay and discover the Rachni. This starts the chain of events that leads to the uplifting of the Krogan as the Citadel Council's military force in fighting the Rachni, believing the bugs are hostile beyond redemption. The Krogan are given new technology and worlds in exchange for foot soldiers. The year 80 is when Krogan begin arriving in force and begin taking the fight to the Rachni.<br><br>81 - 300: The Krogan brutally fight the Rachni, their ability to reproduce with great haste gives them the edge in a fight against the insect race. Krogan fight the Rachni all the way back to Suen and destroy their hives. This leads to the Citadel government declaring the Rachni extinct by 300 and leaving a listening post for possible survivors. The Krogan are hailed as heroes and a statue on the Presidium is raised in honor of their accomplishments.<br><br>301 - 700: Off Tuchanka, Krogan, failing to learn from their past, begin reproducing exponentially, claiming other worlds by force. They even begin taking worlds held by other Council members, each time claiming they needed just "one more world" for living space. One such world is Garvug, a formerly lush planet which the Krogan have ecologically ruined thanks to their poor practices in planetary upkeep. The Krogan then began inhabiting the Asari world of Lusia; the Council refused to hand control of Lusia over to the Krogan and ordered them off the planet. Overlord Kredak, Krogan ambassador to the Council, dared the Council to come take their planets back by force and stormed out of the Council Chambers. This act is considered the start of The Krogan Rebellions.<br><br>701 - ~1000s: When the Rebellions ended is a matter of debate, some say as late as the 1000s, some say at ~780 when Parthian forces nuked the Krogan world of Canrum. The Rebellions were the first official action of the Spectres, easily able to replenish their numbers against Asari and Salarian forces. It took the newcomer to the spacefaring community, the Turians, to prove a brutal match. Krogan used total war, just as the Turians did, so when Turians faced asteroid strikes against several of their colonies rendering them uninhabitable, the Hierarchy lashed back in kind. The resulting action led to the development of the Genophage and the distribution in 710, the crippling virus killing their reproductive capability. Unable to replenish their numbers, Krogan increasingly quit fighting in the face of an unsustainable war, leading many to surrender by the mid 700s. Rogue warlords continued to fight in the meantime and were brutally put down by Legion forces, others taking their bands and leaving to the frontiers and becoming pirates. In any event, the war was over, the Krogan lost, and were in a horrific post-war position.<br><br>~770s - 2203: With the Genophage, and unable to replenish their numbers as before, the Krogan begin their decline. As time goes on, many Krogan believe that without a cure or some change, it will mean the extinction of their people by the end of the 23rd century. Blood Rage has become so pervasive in Krogan society that those without it start becoming rare, but may still come about. This mental illness sees Krogan more focused on fighting each other and militaristic pursuits rather than focusing on reversing the damage. Intellectuals are sneered at and mocked by society. Even the remaining small numbers of Krogan engaged in sciences and philosophy see their own people as a lost cause, but not everyone gives up.<br><br>834 - 1017 CE: Blite openly begins to support Breeding Programs for the Krogan, and staying on their planet to fortify their numbers. His words are passed over by other Clan Leaders, who'd rather continue the meaningless violence that aids the Genophage in thinning the Krogan race.<br><br>905 CE: Blite spent time turning the remaining members of Clan Woade into the brutal Krogan soldiers known post-Genophage. A great deal of them are killed making strikes of vengeance against the Turians.<br><br>900 CE~: The Clans of Vorcha begin to move into abandoned Krogan Clan territories. Hostility begins immediately.<br><br>1012 CE: Jark wants to risk the remaining Krogan with a full scale war with the encroaching Vorcha. Blite is forced to make the decision of killing his father and assuming the role of Clan Leader. Blite has some of the clan to observe the Vorcha to check on breeding habits.<br><br>1034 CE: Blite (and clan Woade) begins exterminating entire (VORCHA) clans during times of breeding and leaving women alive to raise children, allowing the clans to exist near and help being protected by the Krogan. The vorcha under his protection take the clan name of "Woade" in respect to their new 'protectors.' The arbitrary nature of the Vorcha Clans shifted under the new rule in the Krogan Territory.<br><br>1046 CE: Members of Clan Ganar also begin cultivating Vorcha as the Woades had done. (Believe to have inspired Ganar Wrang.)<br><br>1073-1137 CE: Blite realizes how short-sited the Krogan are, giving respect for pointless acts of violence. Blite leaves Woade Shaman and his Krantt incharge of the clan lands in his absence, and goes into space to learn through interaction with other races, and try to find a way to inspire his people to become what they have the potential to be. He finds out about Omega, and it take priority of where he decides to look. Seeing it is governed much like Krogan Territories and Clans, and that it attracted thugs of every race. He was not impressed by Patriarch whom 'ruled' the asteroid. For a ruler he had virtually no visual control, people only listened as far as they had too, not out of respect. Blite began taking missions with Batarian Pirates whom captured races of each kind and sold them as slaves or looted outright. He learned a lot about the rougish Batarians and even heard a little bit of the skittish Batarian government.<br><br>1138-1530 CE: Blite makes his way to the Citadel and finds residence in the Wards. He takes a job as a bouncer at the Club "Flux." Eavesdropping on larger clients. He also begins working Freelance Mercenary job for several information dealers, and funnels a good amount of money on recent Salarian Scientific Advancements, and classes offered on the Citadel to further his own understanding of the sciences behind the technology. He sends blueprints and orders to his Krantt on Wrill that the Krogan should begin a more rigid teaching program for their young, so they are not stupid brutes compared to the rest of the universe. The blueprints and plans focus mostly on vehicles, weapons, and medical treatment. Though a major blueprint is added, an environmental bubble to eliminate the constant use of breathing masks outside of buildings, and would allow better fortification of Woade Territory.<br><br>1531-1767 CE: Blite uses a contact to become a personal bodyguard for an Asari Matriarch, allowing him access to a great deal of Citadel Space, and allowing him to see a great deal of the politics of the rest of the universe, and allowing him to become familiarized with the Asari culture. He was fired for killing a Turian Commander whom insulted him, accidentally. He was challenged and the ensuing headbutt resulted in a crushed skull in the avian species. The Matriarch gave birth to a child of his soon after his termination, one he has never known of.<br><br>1770 CE: Blite returns to Wrill to find his clan had successfully constructed the dome providing them with air to breathe inside of it. The intense heat far too much for any other race (excluding vorcha) to withstand out of an environmental suit, so even if pirates were to raid the dome, could be easily disposed of. Another dome began construction, as the Females was going to be sheltered in its own, and guarded around the clock by elite warriors.<br><br>1800 CE: Female dome completed.<br><br>1837 CE: The Woade Clan begins selling cheap weaponry (through a Middle Man to not allow others to know they were built by Krogan.), providing money for the clan as a whole and the projects Blite had implemented. Krogan of clan Woade being well educated and trained for combat, though most of the children desiring to leave the home world after their rites.<br><br>1850 CE: Advanced technology for the vehicles is gleaned from an information Broker that leads the Woade clan into developing hover crafts with a wider range of motion and quicker top speed for raids against the rising gang numbers.<br><br>1875-2119 CE: Blite goes to Illium to continue information gathering and jobs to continue funding the clans developments.<br><br>1995 CE: Was vowed the allegiance of the clans on Wrill<br><br>2120-2170 CE: Blite is offered a large sum of credits in order to eliminate Mercenary Captains on Illium by a well to do citizen who wished to make Illium a 'safer place.'<br><br>2183 CE: Blite realizes the Krogan need an undefeatable enemy to make them focus on bettering their species and becoming the force they once were, and returns to Wrill.<br>Krogan are reported to have failed yet another opportunity in finding a cure to the Genophage. Scientists begin increasingly turning to insane options like testicle transplants to attempt to boost the possibility of live young. This is where the general Krogan societal view against intellectuals comes back to bite them. It has been over 2000 years since the end of the Rebellions and still no progress made towards curing the Genopahge.<br><br>2184-2198 CE: When Urdnot Wrex begins his uniting of the Clan, Blite personally goes to Tuchanka to offer his support, a few of the Woade Clan members are relocated to Tuchanka as representatives. Blite begins to talk up the Reapers as unbeatable opponents from the tails of Wrex, in order to inspire his clan, he is personally moving throughout the universe to find wayward Krogan, and to convince them to rejoin the Clans and to stop being selfish, as the Krogan will have a battle worth having soon enough.<br>The Corporate War occurs on Garvug in 2185. The end result with loss of life and Corporatist retreat brings in calls for support from other Krogan. Other clans, for once, come together to provide for a defense of Garvug in case of a return of Corporate Forces. It is a sign of things to come, and this lays the foundation for Garvug joining the Empire later, though providing their own protection in exchange for funding due to the remoteness of the territory.<br><br>2200 CE:<br>Began process for Project Restoration.<br>Began Colonization of Virmire.<br>Settled policy with Ganar Yulaz<br>Claimed the title of "Supreme Overlord."<br>Met with Kolvant Rutvor about stance on Kolvant clan's disrespect.<br>Training of Imperial Forces Begins<br>Empire General Assembly begins full-scale productions of various products<br><br>2201:<br>Diplomatic relations are continued with Clan Kolvant to avoid conflict.<br>In an unexpected move with the invasion of the Reapers, the Turian Hierarchy temporarily grants the Empire as a client race to allow the side-stepping of the DMZ to protect Tuchanka.<br>With Imperial Warmaster Ravanor Xarak at the helm, Imperial forces begin the systematic destruction of the Reapers present on Tuchanka.<br>Imperial Warmaster Ravanor Xarak, as well as Kolvantic Champion Kolvant Rutvor, seek out the distress call of Kolvant's females in a daring rescue operation.<br>The culmination of combat efforts on Tuchanka prove overwhelmingly successful, resulting in the liberation of the krogan homeworld and Imperial morale soaring with a few newly-made allies.<br>Honoring the pact made with the Turian Hierarchy, Imperial forces and Independent clans more favorable towards the Empire move to Palaven to assist with the liberation of the Turian homeworld.<br>The fighting on Palaven is fierce and takes its toll on allied forces, Imperial morale begins to wane. That is until it is announced that with the aid of Salarian geneticists at Imperial facilities on Virmire after being displaced by the Reapers have developed an immunization that will cure the Genophage. The krogan people have a future worth fighting for again.<br><br>2202:<br>The Krogan Demilitarized Zone that is enforced by Council peacekeeping forces is formally lifted and disbanded.<br>Kolvant Kolten of Clan Kolvant is appointed as the first ambassador on the Citadel of the krogan people since the abandonment of the post at the dawn of the Reaper War.<br><br>2203:<br>The Empire invests into the beginning of its most ambitious project yet: terraforming Tuchanka and restoring it to its former, garden world glory.<br>Simulated war games between Hierarchy and Imperial military assets as a means to strengthen diplomatic ties and improve training regimes has an unexpected outcome with Imperial victory. Hierarchy military officials acknowledge krogan strength and tactics and begin rewriting their own regarding this change.<br>The Turian Hierarchy honor the fallen krogan on Palaven against the Reapers and their Husks with a memorial in Cipritine Square.<br>Despite public resistance to the idea, Hierarchy naval vessels routinely patrol the Sentry Omega System, by extension, Virmire, as a means to observe Imperial activity, as well as protect their interests<br>Finding a moment of peace to focus on the matter, the Empire officially decrees the limitations and laws surrounding a post-Genophage society to ensure another Rebellion never happens again.<br>The T'Sarvi Utopiate and Krogan Empire reach a deal, allowing a number of Asari experts from the Utopiate to live and work within the Krogan Empire as guest workers. These Asari bring with them naval expertise, Special Forces knowledge, and other skills critical to the Krogan Empire's growing needs. A number immigrate and become Imperial Citizens, offered a fine salary for their expertise.<br>One of these migrants, Admiral Mirah Zhenya, a keen innovator and ship designer by her own right, was made Imperial Navalmaster by Emperor Blite. She gets right to work on reorganizing and reforming the Krogan Navy to turn it into a respectable and efficient naval force akin to that of the Utopiate.<br>A segment of the Genophage Cure is released on the Extranet to Independent clans, undercutting the Empire. Blite's High Overlords do nothing but sit on the news, seeing a way to use it in the future as a cause for war to conquer the Independents. Any news about its release in the Empire is suppressed by their orders.<br><br>2204-2207:<br>Empire General Assembly now has their own functioning shipyard in orbit over Tuchanka, begin constructing naval vessels of Mirah Zhenya's designs, along with Hierarchy naval yards at Aephus and Palaven assisting in the Krogan effort. Zhenya’s vision is a future not of naval warfare stagnation, but of dynamic, mobile warfare, her ships designed to assault the enemy, close the gap, and tear them to death by a thousand cuts.<br>Emperor Blite commits to the Systems Alliance Civil War on the side of the Alliance, after the Systems Alliance offered them the planet of Akuze in return for their assistance. After much bickering and bad information, Blite withdrew from the Civil War under less than reasonable pretenses, harming relations with the Systems Alliance.<br>Rescinding support and depriving the Krogan of a fight angered many of the citizens, calls for Blite’s removal from the seat of Emperor becoming louder with each passing day. Seeing the writing on the wall, and not wanting the Empire to fracture over this political decision, Emperor Blite surrendered his title and went into retirement, throwing the Empire into a time of Regent rule as his replacement was no longer acceptable thanks to his actions. After months of long debate, a contender made a challenge for the throne and defeated his opponent, Hailot Nargor, in mortal combat. The new Emperor, Urdnot Lorkali, assumes the throne as Krogan Lorkali.<br>Upon his ascension to the throne, Lorkali learns of the release of the Genophage cure segment and that the High Overlords did nothing about it. Viewing this not just as high treason against the Empire, but an action against the species as a whole that would give the outside world just cause to exterminate them all, Imperial and Independent alike. He orders the traitorous clan chiefs and hundreds across the Imperial Government in on this, almost to a man sycophants to former Emperor Blite, arrested and their skulls crushed in a public execution. It is very unlike his character and he lamented giving the order, but he needed to send a strong message of what becomes of those who put their lust for war before the good of the species.<br>The Krogan Empire begins construction on their most ambitious project yet: the Victoria-class Super Battlecarrier, the best of Mirah Zhenya's designs.<br>The Battle of Akuze changes naval warfare with the introduction of FTL missile technology. While such a weapon’s introduction now vindicates Imperial Navalmaster Zhenya in her choice of tactics, she, like the rest of the galaxy, scrambles to find countermeasures. Akuze also brings about the end of the Empire's dreadnoughts. The Woade Blite becomes a museum ship that can be recalled into service if needed and the other four ships of the class are either scrapped or cancelled, the last of them serving until 2210.<br><br>2208-2212:<br>To ease tensions, the Krogan Empire begins a trade deal with the newly liberated Atticans in hopes of easing the tensions caused by the Civil War. The Krogan Empire purchases civilian purchased goods from the Atticans in either credits or raw material shipments.<br>Asari experts in the Empire serving as counsel to the Emperor ask Lorkali to begin focusing on civilian product production, as an entire military economy is unsustainable in the long run. Action has yet to be taken on the matter, but Lorkali has started forming a plan.<br>Krogan Lorkali abolishes Krogan Blite's Breeding Regulation, instead issuing his revised regulation. It keeps the Krogan population viable and leads to greater growth as they expand internally.<br>In 04-2212, the Victoria-class Super Battlecarrier, KIN Primo Victoria is finally complete and enters service, the only one of her kind.<br><br><br><br>Culture &amp; Beliefs<br><br>The Empire is not too removed culturally from what Krogan are. There are still many unique rites and traditions in each clan that have been practiced over the ages. Many of these have been preserved; there are some which are much more harmful for Krogan longevity that were abolished under the previous regime. Though, it should be noted that Blite's government was extremely skeptical of incoming traditions. Skepticism still remains as to the reasons why, ranging from insulting Blite's ego to undermining a sort of religious "godemperor" cult around his personage.<br><br>Lorkali has taken a more muted approach since becoming Emperor, smashing the cult of personality surrounding the Emperor. He allows clans to keep their unique rites and traditions so long as they do not breed conflict with other clans or involve the sacrifice of aliens or other Krogan. This won him some support among a small number of moderately Independent clans who have since opened up negotiations with the Empire. He sees this as a positive forward, albeit a slow step, in preserving Krogan culture while breeding new allies that will hopefully unify. His preference is to deal diplomatically and, in typical respect for Krogan strength, they would come around in due course.<br><br>Old and new begin to meet, and Lorkali is trying to move the people away from resorting to a fight first and never questioning it. It's a new direction, not one favored by archtraditionalists, but a valid direction that, as he sees it, will not get the Krogan killed again out of some senseless lust for war.<br><br>Imperial Rites and Holidays<br>Rite of Birth<br>Rite of Passage<br>Rite of Graduation<br>Rite of Conscription<br>Rite of Service<br>Rite of Promotion<br>Rite of Bonding<br>Rite of Breeding<br>Rite of Dominance<br>Rite of Death<br>Renaissance Day - November 11th, 2202 - Celebrated Annually - Marking the date of when the Krogan DMZ was dissolved, it is celebrated as the first progressive step forward for the krogan people in over a millennia and should be cherished<br>Rite of Challenge - A challenge for the chiefdom of any clan, high-ranking appointed military office, or even the throne of Emperor itself.<br><br><br>Imperial Philosophy<br><br>Blite laid a foundation for the Empire's philosophy. It's been improved on over the years, especially under Lorkali.<br>There are other paths besides that of a warrior. As a people, Krogan must also place more value and respect into intelligence, philosophy, the study of the past, scholarly pursuits. Krogan fell down a path of self-destruction from lack of knowledge. It must not be repeated.<br>Isolationism, self-centered actions, these are things which get Krogan killed, and a sign of a lack of character. Krogan must unite, stand together, that is where the species has strength. There is power in numbers, and aliens understand this far more than Krogan have!<br>Krogan must adapt, must prosper, putting the needs of the Empire and Clan above their own. If this isn't done? What hope is there of a future?<br>As a species, Krogan need to start seeing each other as kinsmen. Clan pride is all well and good, but if we are to one day achieve unity, we must all stand shoulder to shoulder! How else can we arise from the ashes stronger than before?!<br>Service to the Empire is akin to service to the Clan. Remember both before personal desires, everyone has something they want, but don't put that before what will make us strong as a species.<br>Diplomacy is the first step. It must be done, there is no escaping this. What can be gained by words and cooperation will far exceed that by force of arms.<br>War is the final resort if all avenues fail. Do not seek it. If it comes to us, stand ready to fight with every sinew.<br>In this vein, do not resort to pointless violence. It is the mark of a savage, and Krogan must become anything but that. If we do not advance beyond base brutality, the aliens will not hesitate to exterminate us down to the last man, woman, and whelp as a failed species too dangerous to be left alive. That is the score, keep that in mind, we are zero for one, and two will be our end.<br><br><br><br>Lexicon<br><br><br>Canon<br>- Rhuzad Judge<br>- Uzin Krogan God of Vengeance<br>- Kruban krogan mythological paradise in which honorable warriors feast on the internal organs of their enemies<br>- Vaul Ancient krogan deity that stood watch for enemies of his pantheon<br>- Aralakh "Eye of Wrath"<br>- korbal translates to "Victory or Death"<br>- krantt A warrior's most trusted allies; brothers in battle/blood<br><br>Non-Canon<br>- Greatest Enemy - Reapers or reference thereof<br>- The Emperor's Fist - Imperial Army/Military might<br>- The Empire's Sword and Shield - Imperial Army/Military Might<br>- Hraezla - Fear/respect<br>- Woozin - Chieftain of the gods<br>- Kharzin - Krogan deity of Rage; Purveyor of the Blood Rage<br>- Arzin - Krogan deity of War; Embodiment of Battle<br>- zin: - god<br><br><br>Clan Hierarchy and Assigned Roles<br><br>The Emperor's Fist is only as strong as the fingers it is composed of. An individual finger lacks the sheer brutality to strike out against the Empire's adversaries to keep them at bay. Together, in unison, and clenched together tightly with purpose, there is no level of protection in the galaxy that will repel the might of the krogan. Levels of representation in the Empire are determined by many contributing factors. Elements such as clan population, territory controlled, economic contributions, military prowess, and other such variables determined the roles fulfilled within the Imperial order. No clan is heralded as superior to another as even the strongest will fall without allies to strengthen their resolve and supply the front lines.<br><br>Emperor<br><br>Description:<br>The Emperor of all Empire-loyal krogan. He is the undisputed ruler, leader of all, a fount of wisdom, ferocity, and commands respect of those beneath him. The Empire's inception was masterminded by Woade Blite over the course of centuries-worth of meticulous planning and preparation financially, technologically, and diplomatically. He is the Chieftain of all krogan, all krogan are his clan, his kinsmen. Any future successors will take on "Krogan" and relieve themselves of their clan in transition through the Rite of Ascension.<br><br>Duties:<br>Chosen ruler of the Empire<br>Diplomatic representative of the Empire in galactic policy making<br>De facto decision-maker of all krogan-centric affairs within the Empire's sovereignty<br>Emperor<br>- Krogan Blite (Formerly Woade Blite) - Abdicated, living in retirement<br>- Krogan Lorkali (Formerly Urdnot Lorkali) - Present Emperor<br><br><br>High Overlords<br><br><br>Description:<br>The High Overlord Clans are amongst the largest, more powerful collectives of clans within the Empire hierarchy. They are responsible for a majority of the provisions made to the Empire, such as the conscription of forces, tribute of resources, credits, labor, and all manner of necessities to ensure the Empire's stability. In return, they hold seats of power in the decision-making process and are only subservient to Emperor Blite. Upon their own homeworlds where their clans are powerful to begin with, they assist in regulating their own beneath Empire rule.<br><br>Duties:<br>Representatives of respective clans<br>Lawmaking and legislation of Imperial decrees and regulation thereof<br>Substantial economical contribution and military support to the Empire<br>High Overlord Clans<br>Virmire/Wrill: Woade clan<br>Virmire: Drau clan<br>Virmire: Guroth clan<br>Tuchanka: Urdnot clan<br>Tuchanka: Ravanor clan<br>Tuchanka: Nakmor clan<br>Tuchanka: Kolvant clan<br>Wrill: Ganar clan<br>Garvug: Hailot clan<br>Garvug: Virul clan<br><br><br>Overlord Clans<br><br>Description:<br>Overlord Clans are somewhat smaller than the High Overlord clans, but still respectably powerful in their own right. They act as liaisons between the High Overlords and the other levels in the Hierarchy to deliver down Imperial information as messengers and enforcers of Imperial Law where the High Overlords cannot tend to. These clans, given their lower numbers but strength, take priority for special duties during conscription, such as support roles and special forces. This does not limit their conscription from Imperial Troopers, but merely an option to preserve the clans and not deplete their numbers.<br><br>Duties:<br>Diplomatic liaisons between High Overlord clans and other Empire-aligned clans<br>Enforcers of Imperial Law, typically through the Imperial Army or Imperial Internal Affairs<br>Conscripted forces fulfill support and special forces roles in the Imperial Army<br>Overlord Clans<br>Rogar<br>Jorgal<br>Raik<br>Weyrloc<br>Gatatog<br><br><br>Warlord Clans<br><br>Description:<br>Warlord clans are smaller, but still supportive. Very much like in Imperial Philosophy, each must do their part and do so unquestionably in service to the greater scheme of things rather than selfishly for themselves. Warlord Clans assist Overlord Clans in their assigned duties decreed by Imperial Law. Conscription guarantees support roles for these clans to preserve their numbers and keep them away from the front lines. Imperial Troopers are nothing without logistics and support backing them up. Such clans provide the specialty forces for additional training by the Empire to fill the roles.<br><br>Duties:<br>Provide assistance of Overlord Clans in carrying out their duties<br>Conscription for support roles in the Imperial Army<br>Imperial Troopers from these clans typically fulfill logistics roles but also serve in combat roles<br>Warlord Clans<br><br>Forsan<br>Quash<br>Jurdon<br><br><br>Battlelord Clans<br><br>Description:<br>Battlelord clans are normally offshoots/branches of Warlord clans and fulfill similar roles.<br><br>Duties:<br>Provide assistance of Warlord Clans in carrying out their duties<br>Conscription for support roles in the Imperial Army<br>Imperial Troopers from these clans typically fulfill logistics roles<br>Battlelord Clans<br>Bant<br>Rox<br>Taylth<br><br><br>Skirmishlord Clans<br><br>Description:<br>Skirmishlord clans are the smallest gatherings of clans in the Empire Hierarchy. More often than not, they are but a few dozen at the most and are more nomadic than their more populous brethren. They are more often than not the heralds, the messengers of the word of the Empire, spreading its good fortune it can bring to the krogan as a whole wherever they go. What they lack in numbers of raw, brute strength, they make up with the power of words and academics.<br><br>Skirmishlord Clans<br></div><br><br><div class="spoilermaintitle" align="left" onclick="$(this).next().toggle()">Reference 2</div><div class="spoilertablefill" style="display:none; text-align: left;">Imperial Armed Forces<br><br><br>Like any Empire, the Krogan require a military. It is in their blood, warriors built by centuries of adaptation to the harsh reality of the galaxy. From a homeworld where they are prey, the lowest on the food chain, survival was a day-to-day activity and continues to be so in present times. Conflict is their way of life. While most of the galaxy views them as brutal, pragmatic, and in some cases, unintelligent and undeveloped, the krogan are masters of the art of warfare. They have an affinity, an appreciation for it, and dying in battle against a formidable foe is no greater honor to be bestowed. They live for the fight, desire strong enemies, and wish there is no shortage in the near future.<br><br>While times have changed, both literally and metaphorically between the advancement of the galaxy and the Genophage impacting krogan reproduction rates, the Empire desired to keep that aspect of their livelihood alive and well. The Imperial Army harnesses that chaotic aura of a battle-hardened krogan and disciplined it. The average krogan is quite dangerous and difficult to combat. An Imperial Trooper is much of the same, multiplied many times over, and follows orders like a properly structured military. They are not drones, but controlled chaos. A rule-of-thumb that is followed by the regime is the average Imperial Trooper should be capable of besting up to 10 average krogan warriors in combat by themselves, double that for "lesser" races. Such success comes at a price, however.<br><br>As decreed by the Imperial Warmaster and forefather of the training regime, each graduating class of Imperial Troopers is allotted up to 20% failure rate to be deemed "acceptable". The current average failure rate has been curbed back to just 10% with supervision from instructing Battlemasters. Injuries are down as well with substantial medical staff on standby. Even krogan can suffer wounds after all. Those who fail to make the grade for infantry go on to serve in other roles during their conscription period.<br><br>In 2206, Emperor Krogan Lorkali reformed the Imperial Military ranking structure. This created distinct Officer and Other Ranks pathways for personnel and makes Krogan forces far more efficient than an odd NCO to Officer path previously implemented, along with rectifying a lack of enlisted level ranks. The current Imperial Armed Forces setup is far more effective than the initial setup.<br><br>Structure<br><br><br>Each Empire-loyal is allowed to retain its own fighting force. The training varies depending on the clan, as does equipment; some clan forces may put up a strong showing against Imperial Troopers with a possibility of victory, with others no better off than as a defensively-oriented militia force. The Empire asks of each clan 10% of their warriors for conscription into the Imperial Army. Clans tend to send their best, wanting to make a good showing. During training to become an Imperial Trooper, all conscripts first learn that they are brothers in arms, that their clan's name or prestige means little. They will obey the orders of their superiors or they will soon learn a very harsh lesson in reality. Those unable to adapt are usually forced into other duties fit for an undesirable, where those who learn and adapt go on to fill various combat roles, with top scorers in infantry. Those with keen intellect are usually slated for other roles which make the most use of their mind.<br><br>Asari who immigrate to the Empire as full citizens have a similar demand of them under Krogan conscription laws, given they live as long as Krogan can feasibly if not stupid. While they may have a service mandate, they do not have to serve it in the military, but can serve in any government or civil service role as well. Those who serve in the military tend to be careerists, Army and Navy alike, preferring to join for a commitment, rather than a short time. If aliens earn full citizenship within one of the Clans, or even the Empire at large, they are exempt from mandatory service, but may volunteer to serve.<br><br>The building block of the soldier forms the basis, from here, it is up the ladder all the way to the highest echelon, with the Emperor as Commander in Chief of the Krogan Armed Forces. The effort to coordinate the entire military in its day to day operations, as well as to advise the Emperor on military matters is the responsibility of the Joint Chief of Staff. The Krogan exist in a quasi-military controlled state of their Armed Forces, with the Emperor able to issue orders. While the Joint Chief does have the nominal head of the Minister of War, in practice, he answers directly to the Emperor, giving him a direct line to the Armed Forces that sidesteps the civilian appointee. Even if a lower rank than the Imperial Warmaster and Imperial Navalmaster, the Joint Chief is superior in command and will be paid proper respect.<br><br>The current Joint Chief of Staff is Warmaster Nakmor Khuyas.<br><br><br><br>Philosophy<br><br><br>In line with Emperor Blite's own words, as well as Imperial Warmaster Xarak's wise counsel, the Krogan Imperial Military, both Army and Navy alike, follow similar guidelines. Unlike generations gone by, this is not a gathering of the largest, strongest, most veteran of warriors to throw at the nearest obstacle. Blite, Xarak, and the High Overlords have used life lessons, experience, and research from across the galaxy to construct a training regime that would harness the raw fury that many knew the krogan for in combat, and turn it into a controllable, malleable force capable of acting as any professional army would. <br><br>Strength without order is chaos.<br>Strength without direction is squandered potential.<br>Strength without discipline is weakness.<br><br>Structure, order, and discipline has sharpened the dulled edge of a blade that was once krogan into something razor-honed and swift to strike with extreme precision and lethality. From reckless, brutal warriors to a well-trained, well-disciplined professional, the transformation of the species' military might into a vision of tomorrow has been something sorely needed and paramount to future success.<br><br>The Empire's primary military force is limited by the War Department's annual budget. Under Emperor Lorkali, the emphasis of the Krogan military has changed greatly; there is no disputing Krogan might on the ground, their technology is strong, their infantry strong; in fact, even the mighty Hierarchy Legions fighting the Imperial Army would lead to a gruesome slaughter in a ground campaign. Lorkali has recognized this, knowing no Council force would willingly send their forces into a grinder, and has shifted emphasis to the Imperial Navy. In the age of RKM weaponry, this emphasis has paid off, with the Krogan developing a unique doctrine to combat the most recent threat, and something that plays to their natural and national advantages. Only time can tell which untested new doctrine would be proven right and if the Krogan Empire may have invested much into a Navy only to see it proven naught but straw.<br><br><br><br>Training and Tactics<br><br><br>Imperial Hand-to-Hand/Melee Combat Training<br><br><br>-Para: A form of martial art developed by the Krogan, and often only Krogan were capable of performing it. While Krogan were more often known for their exertion of brute force, Para was surprisingly widely known, due to the natural violence of Krogan society and rites. Together with the natural strength of a giant reptile, it made a fearsome weapon. The martial art focused on using the immense upper body strength of the species, with an emphasis on punches, jabs and throws, and usually only a few strikes at a time. Also surprising were the non-lethal options available to the Krogan using the art, practitioners capable of disabling an opponent with a single blow.<br><br>- Living Ram: The style focuses on strong upper-body strikes powered by both muscle and body movement, as well as powerful knee strikes and stomping kicks. Defense relies primarily on avoiding or withstanding attacks.<br><br>The beginnings of Living Ram training are characterized by long, deep stances designed to develop strength in the martial artist's legs. Then, repetitive basic punches and kicks are added to improve muscle memory and develop upper-body strength and overall flexibility. Living Ram teachings were famous for their day-long training sessions where students would stay in a prescribed stance for upwards of ten hours, constantly punching and kicking. As training progressed, students were required to learn how to take blows from each other – as the student climbed in prowess, the blows would become more forceful.<br><br>Living Ram is characterized by hard upper-body strikes and stomping kicks. The attacks are designed to penetrate an opponent's guard through the sheer level of damage inflicted. <br><br>The art's name was taken from a story of the first Master, Jar Dol, who reputedly smashed open a meter-thick wooden gate with one blow of his fist. Because of the nature of the strikes, Living Ram practitioners tend to avoid secondary blocks, and train themselves to dodge or simply absorb attacks.<br><br>Lower-level students tend to dodge more, while more experienced fighters could shrug off most strikes. Masters of Living Ram were legendary for their resilience, able to brush away even the fiercest of unarmed blows.<br><br>-Rolling Boulder: A more recent addition to the training regime, one instructed and masterminded by Imperial Warmaster Ravanor Xarak. While Rolling Boulder is not by any means an original martial art, is is more or less his impressive experience and wisdom rolled into a complete package. After several centuries of traveling the galaxy as a mercenary, coming across all manner of foes of a wide variety of shapes and sizes, Xarak quickly saw the effectiveness of various techniques from different races. Utilizing this observation and curiosity, he went on to learn as much as possible about them, especially on the rare occasions he was contracted to work with others in a group.<br><br>Essentially, Rolling Boulder is as "un-krogan" of a fighting style in hand-to-hand and melee combat as one can think. It utilizes not the krogan raw strength and brute force of their size, but the opponent's own inertia against them. A more defensive, reactive style than offensive, it is meant to preserve as much energy as possible while incapacitating or killing the opponent with as little effort necessary. Brutally efficient and further enforced by a krogan practitioner, the style focuses upon parries, counters, quick strikes, sweeps, submissions. Targets are usually opponent joints, bones, and other critical locations meant to break, shatter, or dislocate to neutralize the threat.<br><br>Xarak's goal is to turn an Imperial Trooper with a utility blade into a force to be reckoned with, proving that the krogan are just as potentially lethal without a firearm, but a simple blade or even their bare hands. It is surprising to see a sense of fluidity about their movements with Rolling Boulder.<br><br>-Armed Melee: There are a number of Krogan martial arts that revolve around the use of weapons, not unlike Asari and Turian traditionalists. Krogan are known more for use of blunt weapons, warhammers and maces for instance, making use of a brutal weapon with a wider surface area to strike a target and bring the most use out of their natural upper body strength. There are also those who prefer the use of bladed weapons from longswords to battleaxes. These arts are meant for one real purpose, and that's to make sure the adversary doesn't get off the ground again. A Krogan even using the pommel of a sword to deliver a knockout strike has a possibility of fracturing a skull, defeating the idea of a non-lethal take down.<br><br>Ground Tactics<br><br><br>The Krogan are a strong military force on the ground. The discipline of Imperial Troopers, the implementation of combined arms tactics, learning from the past and using tactics other than swarm warfare have turned the Imperial Army into a force to be reckoned with. Some military analysts have found that it would take an entire Alliance tank squadron of 4-6 tanks to defeat a single Krogan MBT. The Imperial Army is, at this point, considered to be an equal to Citadel forces thanks to emphasis paid on the Imperial Army in the opening years of the Empire. While emphasis has shifted to the Navy, the Army still continues to train and use artillery, armor, naval and army air support, and infantry in deadly concert with each other. Anyone expecting an easy foe should think twice.<br><br>Naval Tactics<br><br><br>Krogan naval tactics are incredibly aggressive. These tactics have been developed by Imperial Navalmaster Mirah Zhenya before the advent of RKMs with the hope of breaking the stagnation of naval combat by forcing a more dynamic route. Her whole premise was to render the main weapon of an enemy's warship, the spinal gun, absolutely useless. The goal is to close to within 6 kilometers of the enemy (or closer even) in a full assault and then utilize the many cannons typically used for flak barriers to tear an enemy ship to death. Death by a thousand cuts rather than large blows. The Krogan also contributed, of their own design, saturation attacks with missiles from their cruisers. It's a highly aggressive naval tactic for a highly aggressive people, bringing all ships into combat than leave any sitting as targets for their enemy.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Armed Forces Branches of the Empire<br><br><br>Imperial Army<br><br><br>Imperial Troopers are krogan warfare perfected, designed to be as ruthless, methodical, and efficient as possible, utilizing training and tactics rather than numbers due to the Genophage and controlled breeding after it was cured. There is no room for weakness in the Imperial Army, each Trooper must rely upon one another in full and entrust them with their lives. What they lack in numbers, they make up with superior training and an unbreakable will of determination and sense of duty in loyal service to the advancement of the krogan once more.<br><br>Imperial Troopers are conscripted for service annually from all Empire-loyal clans, taking 10% of their best warriors yearly to supplement them into the training regime, turning the best into the elite. Enduring the hardships of hand-to-hand combat training, melee combat training with all manner of weapons and tools, firearms proficiency, squad tactics, survival exercises, and all manner of other tests, over the course of 2 months, those that reach the end of the program with a sufficient passing score by overseeing Battlemasters acting as instructors graduate to join the ranks of the Imperial Army.<br><br>Those that fail to make the cut of Imperial Troopers, but managed to survive the training are allowed to attempt as many times necessary. If they desire not to, they are placed in lesser/supportive roles, such as the Imperial Armored Corps. For a krogan, while being at the helm of a 300 ton rolling death machine is a dream come true, they have several inches of armor plating and barriers between them and the action, not exactly thrilling or respectable by other krogan of what they do. All desire to be Imperial Troopers, not all are capable, it is reality.<br><br>Non-Krogan forces, small in number, are organized into rear echelon units. Alien infantry units are extremely uncommon, and are usually platoons attached to second line Krogan units at best. Usually, aliens serve in non-combat duties but can still fight if the enemy comes to them. Though, some officers from Senawuk's Utopiate Eternal Guard have come to the Empire to assist Krogan officers in training their forces in the finer arts of Asari warfare from scouting missions to laying ambushes. The expertise of aliens brought to the table have been welcomed by higher ranking Krogan echelons to turn the Imperial Army into a well rounded force rather than the main Krogan focus on blunt force and overwhelming firepower.<br><br>Imperial Trooper Loadout<br><br><br>Imperial Army<br>EGA Resurrection Heavy Armor Mk. 3 (Coloration varies by rank)<br>General-Purpose Omni-Tool (Specialized Omni-Tool for specific roles, i.e. Marksman, Artillery, etc)<br>General-Purpose Medi-Gel Delivery System<br>Spare Power Cells<br>EGA Utility Knife MkII<br>Magnetic Compass<br>Provisions/Rations<br>Thermal Clips<br><br>Active Duty<br><br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 HAWS Assault Rifle (Active Duty Rifleman)<br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 ASG Assault Shotgun (Active Duty Assault/CQC Trooper)<br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 SAW Light Machinegun (Active Duty Support Gunner)<br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 PSR Sniper Rifle (Active Duty Marksman)<br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 HP "Quadstopper" Heavy Pistol (Standard Sidearm)<br>EGA T95 Mod 1 Helix for use by Asari Forces<br><br>Reserve/Civilian Defense<br><br>EGA T94 Mod 2 HAWS (various attachments)<br><br><br><br>Imperial Army Ranks and Color Designations<br><br>Current Total Garrison:<br>1,950,000 (03-2212 - Continued Growth) - Active Duty<br>25,010,000 (03-2212 - Continued Growth) - Reserve/Civilian Defense<br>Ranks and Color Schemes:<br><br><br>Technician ranks were added with the 2206 reforms by Emperor Lorkali.

Under the guidance of Imperial Navalmaster Mirah Zhenya, the Krogan Navy has evolved from a force of no direction aside from causing damage to land on a planet with great haste to a force to be reckoned with. The Imperial Navy developed into a mainly defensive force, but has some offensive capabilities with limited power projection potential in the ability to land a single field army in an invasion at any one time. They are only limited by what the Hierarchy would permit, and Zhenya has very well made her plans known to them. They are not in conflict, but rather in sync.<br><br>Being a respectable size nation for Krogan and still expanding internally within areas they control, the Navy has the means to afford a suitable navy to patrol its many realms. New ships have been built in accordance with what Zhenya had envisioned as her “gray navy doctrine” prior to her becoming part of the Krogan Empire. This doctrine is based on the principle that the best defense is a good offense. Heavily reliant on aggressive ship movements to close the distance and the use of fighters for defense and superiority. This was later coupled with Krogan missile cruisers for saturation attacks. Krogan frigates remain in use as dropships to land troops onto a planet for a mass deployment before departing, keeping out of AAA range as they do so.<br><br>The Battle of Akuze and the Systems Alliance Civil War changed everything with the introduction of a new technology: FTL missiles. While this provides greater usefulness for Zhenya’s tactics in this new era of naval combat, and finally breaks the stagnation of ranged combat, it has thrown her plans into some tumult in reconfiguring the Navy’s size, maximum allowed per ship class, and develop yet more ships of other types to compensate for the new threat.<br><br>Even with some tumult in recent years, this is an innovator’s market in the system right now, and business is booming. The Krogan Imperial Navy is now a fine force suitable for a Grade A government, with Asari naval competency training Krogan in the art of naval warfare and refining those who already have experience. Pirates, raiders, slavers, and Independents should reconsider their life choices if they choose to fight the Imperial Navy.<br><br>Imperial Navy Loadout<br><br><br>Imperial Navy<br>EGA General Purpose Hardsuit for Asari Crew<br>EGA Pilot Hardsuit for Asari and Krogan Pilots<br>EGA Resurrection Heavy Armor Mk. 3<br>General-Purpose Omni-Tool<br>General-Purpose Medi-Gel Delivery System<br>Spare Power Cells<br>EGA Utility Knife MkII<br>Provisions/Rations<br>Thermal Clips<br><br>Active Duty<br><br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 HAWS Assault Rifle (Marine Rifleman)<br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 ASG Assault Shotgun (Marine Assault/CQC Trooper)<br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 SAW Light Machinegun (Marine Support Gunner)<br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 PSR Sniper Rifle (Marine Marksman)<br>Empire General Assembly T94 Mod 2 HP "Quadstopper" Heavy Pistol (Standard Sidearm)<br>EGA T94 Mod 2 PDW and Export Pistol (Pilot Atmospheric Survival Kit)<br>EGA Type 95 Mod 1 Helix for Asari Marines and crew<br><br><br>Imperial Navy Ranks and Color Designations<br><br><br>Current Total Garrison: 575,000 (03-2212 - Limited Growth)<br><br>Ranks and Color Schemes<br><br><br>With the 2206 reforms, Imperial Navalmaster Mirah Zhenya expanded the ranking table to bring the Krogan Imperial Navy to be more in line with that of a typical navy.

They ensure that taxes are paid, and that no quarrels amongst clans threaten the stability of the Empire. While clans are still expected to deal with their own criminals within, any group who initiates unnecessary hostilities with allies, or challenges the law set down by the Empire will have the full force of the law brought down upon them by the IIA. Members are recruited into IIA in a similar fashion to how one joins the Imperial Army – they must display certain qualities that the Empire holds in high regard: efficiency in combat, a calm and diplomatic nature, and a cool head under pressure to gain recognition and an invitation to serve. Members are usually veterans of the Imperial Army, though this is not a requirement. Members, as representatives of the Empire, are held to a high standard of behavior and professionalism.<br><br>When not dealing with major conflicts, the members of the IIA operate out of stations scattered all throughout the Empire to serve as an average police force. Having their forces widespread allows them to know the state of the clans and supervise them at all times. All stations report directly to the central government, although every branch is fully capable of operating by itself in the event of a loss of communication.<br><br>Overall, the IIA is a brutally efficient force. They are the glue that holds the empire together, keeping the clans united under the law and maintaining relative peace to ensure infighting does not cause the krogan people to become weak due to instability. Determined to make a new name for themselves amongst the universe as a people ready to cooperate and contribute to the galaxy, the krogan strive for strength through peace and stability.<br><br>With the introduction of Asari from Senawuk, Imperial Internal Affairs has gained the capability in founding an intelligence arm. This agency, creating the jobs of field agents, intelligence agents, and analysts. Some law enforcement personnel also help to refine police activity in IIA. Headquartered at Virmire, the froundation of the Empire's intelligence wing was laid in 2203.

The Special Reconnaissance Unit, composed of Asari, carrying out reconnaissance missions quietly and discreetly, many of their operations classified and of a clandestine nature.

To that end, He has decreed that Krogan Breeding shall continue to be regulated in the Traditional Manner. Furthermore He has also declared that New Laws pertaining to breeding and the raising of the Empire’s Children shall henceforth be passed, effective immediately. It shall be the Duty of every Loyal Clan Leader to ensure that these Laws are followed to the Spirit and the Letter.<br><br>1.

All Contracts shall be compared and matched by Imperial Matchmakers, so as to better ensure the Future of our Species.<br><br>2. Any Krogan found guilty of Criminal Activity, found connected to Subversive or Treasonous Sects and Associations, found connected to Enemies of the Citadel, or found guilty of Cowardice and other Shameful Acts, are barred from applying for Breeding Contracts.<br><br>3. Further, breeding with Krogan affiliated with Rebellious Clans and Factions is forbidden, except under the Provision of the Emperor.<br><br>4. An Imperial Subject or Vassal is entitled to two ongoing Breeding Requests. Imperial Citizens may have Three ongoing Breeding Requests. Krogan of higher Imperial Rank may apply for further numbers of Requests. The Emperor, as the Personification of our Species’ Strength and Destiny, may have Twelve ongoing Requests.<br><br>5.

No longer shall Asari, who have served with us faithfully these past three years be barred from the same rights that Krogan enjoy.

Krogan are free to breed as they deem fit within Imperial borders, so long as they have permission from clan chieftains as per the customary norm for inter-clan bondings and matches. The Ministry of Imperial Lineage and Heritage founded by Emperor Blite is henceforth dissolved and replaced with the Census Department to keep track of population growth and demographics. The decision of bondings and breeding is better left under the auspices of Clan Chiefs, not the Emperor.<br><br>2. Any Krogan found guilty of criminal activity, found connected to subversive or treasonous sects and associations, found connected to enemies of the Empire are barred from requesting breeding contracts.<br><br>3: Breeding with Krogan affiliated with Independent clans and factions is forbidden, except as deemed fitting by Clan Chiefs. This is a matter far below the Emperor's importance and, again, is better an issue left to the Clan Chiefs.<br><br>4: Breeding requests are subject to a maximum number:<br>Subjects and Vassals: Up to two<br>Citizens: Three<br>High ranking military/government officers, Emperor, and clan chiefs: Up to seven<br><br>These maximums may be waived by the Emperor on a case by case basis.<br><br>5: Offspring shall be nurtured by their clan of birth, with the Empire providing support for these nurseries via financial or personnel support if requested by the Chiefs. Offspring shall be examined by Imperial doctors and treated as necessary given illnesses or potential defects. The practice of euthanizing set forth by Emperor Blite is henceforth revoked. Breeding percentage shall not exceed two percent population growth nationally.<br><br>Asari citizens, as directed by Emperor Lorkali in 2206, will receive citizenship if born to an Imperial father. This is applied retroactively to the date of the Empire's founding. Asari children born prior to the formation of the Empire are welcome to file the necessary papers for Imperial Citizenship if so desired.<br><br>Breeding shall be restricted at the Empire level to the aforementioned population cap, with Chiefs to keep the Empire’s census department up to date on number of births in the clan to accurately keep track of the percentage of growth. Asari citizens will not count towards the percentage of growth given their slower development rates over Krogan young.<br><br>Breeding outside of regulations carries the following penalties:<br><br>First Offense:<br>Prison sentence with hard labor, suspension of breeding rights for up to three years after sentence is completed to be determined by the courts.<br><br>Second Offense:<br>Longer term prison sentence with hard labor, suspension of breeding rights for up to ten years after sentence is completed to be determined by the courts.<br><br>Third Offense:<br>Imprisonment with hard labor for minimum of 100 years but no more than 200.<br><br>Fourth Offense:<br>Imprisonment with hard labor for 300 years.<br><br>Fifth Offense:<br>Exile<br><br>Rapists will have a prison term equal to that of the fourth offense. Serial rapists will face execution by beheading by the Imperial Executioner.<br><br>So it is commanded that Clan Chiefs will promulgate this law and see it enforced, replacing the regulation of 2203. Any Clan continuing to use the scheme of 2203 shall face Imperial Revenge.<br><br><br><br><br>Diplomatic Standings<br><br><br>Friendly Factions<br><br>Friendly Factions<br><br>QUOTE (The Citadel Council)<br>Joining under Emperor Blite, the decision to join the Council has had a mostly negative view from Krogan, Independent and Imperial alike. The prevailing view among Imperial citizens is that the Krogan Empire is not its own sovereign nation, but being treated as a vassal state to the Big Four, with Krogan no better than second class citizens. Many Imperial citizens wonder why Emperor Blite chose to join the organization that spent the better part of 2000 years suppressing them as a species and didn't care for Krogan outside of that until Reapers were at the gates. Emperor Lorkali himself is also against the Empire's status as an Associate nation, especially given his primary goal of calming strife with Independent clans and internally to avoid a Civil War within the Krogan population. He's been exploring ideas to break away from being labeled a "Council nation" but still wants to continue dealing with member states as a firm believer in diplomacy and the direction he's trying to take the Krogan as a species.<br><br>QUOTE (Turian Hierarchy)<br>"The Turian Hierarchy views the Krogan Empire as a valuable partner in our societal mission to provide Galactic security. In not letting our troubled past destroy our shared desire for future peace, turian-krogan cooperation provides a role model for the rest of the Galaxy." - Chief Primarch Valens Suedonis<br><br>QUOTE (The Blood Pack)<br>The Blood Pack and Krogan Empire have a very loose friendship. The Terminus-based company are Krogan, and the Krogan mentality is to stick together. While on friendly terms, the Empire and Pack keep visible distance from each other, given their public perception, though there's no bad blood between each other. Unlike that which the Pack has for the Council.<br><br>QUOTE (Clan Kolvant)<br>“It’s time we stopped nursing grudges long dead. This the dawn of a new century, and a new age. Our future lies with the Empire, and we will not be brought down by those too foolish and short-sighted to see this!” - Chieftain Kolvant Rutvor<br><br>QUOTE (T'Sarvi Utopiate)<br>The Empire enjoys close relations with the Utopiate of Senawuk. Even with only a couple hundred thousand of their citizens living within the Empire itself, Krogan highly respect these Asari, the relationship going back with some of the Clans before the Empire's foundation. It takes a certain type of individual to live within the Terminus and be successful, and these types of individuals are highly respected by Krogan. There's a fair bit of travel between the Utopiate and Empire, especially with Krogan taking up hunting Senawuk's wild game and Senawuk's huntresses trying their hand at Thresher Maws on Tuchanka. Aside from a close affinity and a number of workers living within the Empire, a number of high ranking officials in the Empire's military are immigrants. The Empire is glad to have this relationship with the Utopiate and hopes to maintain it well into the future.<br><br><br><br>Neutral Factions<br><br>Neutral Factions<br><br>QUOTE (Asari Republics)<br>"The formation of the Krogan Empire brought many of the disparate krogan clans into its fold as a unified entity to represent and project the best interests of its citizens, and is a productive step forward in stabilizing the combined will of a proud people.  The Asari Republics hope that the amenable attitude of the current government persists, allowing for the resurrection of open cultural and societal borders, re-opening the free trade of ideas and knowledge to and from krogan worlds by the wider galaxy.  There is much still to be learned from one another, and the Republics hopes to welcome the Empire and its citizens into a happier, brighter age of cooperation, understanding, and prosperity."<br><br>QUOTE (The Systems Alliance)<br>During the Systems Alliance Civil War, the Alliance guaranteed the Krogan Empire ownership of Akuze in exchange for war support against the Attican Insurrection. The Empire initially committed, but later withdrew from the war effort over less than sufficient moral quandaries. This left a very sour taste in the mouths of these humans. The alliance with them is shattered, leaving it alive only on paper, with the Alliance reluctant to trust the Krogan again. The Alliance's defeat has also not helped relations on the Krogan side either, many now seeing them as weak and unworthy of an alliance.<br><br>QUOTE (Salarian Union)<br>"Out of all the strengths of the krogan people, there has always been one prominent trait - their ability to endure. And the Krogan Empire is their latest testament to that endurance, for after so many tragic years of violence and anarchy on their own world, the Salarian Union applauds their ability to unite to a common cause - peace. It is our hope that their future will never again lead to total war." - Premier Dalatrass Myrrith Nakh"<br><br>QUOTE (Batarian Hegemony)<br>On them time will tell, and I listen for that moment.<br><br>QUOTE (Volus)<br>I have not interacted with them, but they move almost in our opposite. They are to economy what the salarians are to knowledge. Unfortunately, that gives us a dull perspective of them.<br><br><br><br>Unfriendly Factions<br><br>Unfriendly Factions<br><br>QUOTE (Blue Suns)<br>"While we make no comment as to the legitimacy of the Krogan Empire or their aims, the Blue Suns are more than happy to do business with them should they require it. We look forward to a mutually beneficial working relationship together." - Chief of Operations Cascaro Hekarian<br><br>QUOTE (Eclipse)<br>"Oh, how charming...while they don't present an immediate threat, they are potential customers of of our services. I suppose it is admirable they are finally picking themselves up out of the dirt and their own feces to join the rest of the galaxy in modern times." - Commandant Adraxa Litharus<br><br>QUOTE (Cerberus)<br><br>"Krogans are by definition, warlike: It has been branded into their very makeup. Whilst humans possess the evolutionary advantage of being born a clean slate to grow up and adapt to her surroundings, these beasts have nothing but the instinct to fight, kill and test any opposition from conception, and thus the very act of organizing themselves is by that definition, a act of war. Their aberrant nature might have been a vital trait when their fate was tied to the very world that spawned them, and potentially a productive one had they never gained any rights as sentient beings.. but now they are no more than a weed that needs a stronger toxin."<br>―Illusive Man<br><br>QUOTE (Attican State)<br>The Atticans haven’t forgotten the Alliance selling Akuze to the Krogan, and are equally angered at the Empire for their original support of the Alliance’s war effort. Though the Empire withdrew before they committed troops, the intent still warrants a fair deal of anger. In the aftermath of the war, the Krogan Empire and Atticans negotiated a trade agreement for civilian goods in exchange for some Imperial raw materials and/or credits. This small step to ease relations may go a long way.<br><br><br><br>Hostile Factions<br><br>Hostile Factions<br><br>QUOTE (Bacalou Skulls (Remnants))<br>Given the release of the Genophage Cure to the Independents in 2203, the Bacalou Skulls has firmly found its way into the Empire's "Most Wanted" section. Imperial Internal Affairs has began actively searching for the whereabouts of Baclaou leadership with the intent of using extraordinary rendition or assassination to deal with them. Current standing orders for the Imperial Military are to engage any Bacalou Skulls targets on sight with no warning given. Any who surrender are to be interrogated and then disposed of.

Upon ascension, Lorkali demolished the standing rule, decentralizing the economy and allowing the rise of private enterprise. This change has allowed a capitalist Krogan economy to rise from black markets that previously existed under Blite's system. Within 5 years, the Imperial economy has emerged from a spiraling debt that would have led to a massive breakdown in the economy to a self-sustaining and budding economy with private ventures taking over where government owned ventures once existed.<br><br>Empire General Assembly, once operating under complete government control, has been allowed to act autonomously under government oversight.
